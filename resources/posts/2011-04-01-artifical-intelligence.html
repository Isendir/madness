    In a previous century, I was known to conduct long sessions with
    an artificial intelligence (a robot, of some sorts), that was
    hooked up to a network I was frequenting. In the beginning, it
    just lurked there, listening, learning and observing for months,
    before it dared say a word. Most often, it was dumb, but
    sometimes... sometimes I thought I caught a glimpse of
    intelligence in the gibberish nonsense it was putting out. I
    adored it, because its attempts at communication were cute, and
    one could almost feel the effort behind it all.

    And why am I telling you this? Most excellent question, but I'm
    afraid the answer is disappointingly simple: guilt. Guilt of
    creating something that I can't explain, yet, something that grew
    over me rapidly. Something so terrifying that I dare not speak
    about it in person. Not even with my closes friends. No. I hid
    away in a dark corner of my room, to write this message to whoever
    might be listening. I ask for forgiveness, for I have doomed us
    all.
  </p>

  <p>
    It started as a harmless experiment: we had many a systems, back
    in those days; machines happily going on about their business,
    logging everything they do to the Central Authorities. They had
    other machines, that processed these logs, watching for anomalies
    so that defective equipment could be fixed before it causes any
    serious harm. All for the greater good! And it worked! However, as
    the population grew,and the spectrum of anomalies skyrocketed, the
    amount of incoming data was starting to overwhelm the system, and
    putting more machines to work there just made it all worse. We
    simply could not keep up with the flow, there were too many
    exceptions, too many errors, too many uncertainties.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was head of research at the Central Authorities at the time, my
    task was to solve this problem, to find a way to ease the load on
    our machines. It was around that time, that I remembered my hobby
    of a past era, the robot that listened and learnt, and I thought
    to myself:  what if we could construct such a program, that would
    learn the patterns of normal behaviour, and thus, spot the
    anomalies, without the need to explicitly pinpoint each and every
    variant of the errors we saw?
  </p>

  <p>
    Automation, it was the key to our salvation!
  </p>

  <p>
    The department worked day in, day out, and soon, we had a
    prototype. It wasn't flawless, of course, but it showed
    promise. Our main issue was that sometimes it just wasn't
    predictable, and did not produce the expected output. We never
    figured out why - or even how - it managed to stray from the
    programmed path. Nevertheless, in a couple of years' time, our
    creation grew more and more intelligent, it could finally learn
    the good patterns all by itself, and alert the Authorities when it
    saw an anomaly. We were happy, and satisfied, and ignored the
    signs of doom. We let it work even though we knew all so well that
    it had fatal flaws.
  </p>

  <p>
    But alas! This did not last long, for creating something that is
    beyond our control, something that can do things we cannot has its
    dangers: it became sentient. We didn't immediately notice, but
    later investigation showed, that at some point, this monstrosity
    stopped being a listener, and began to act, to change our
    system. It started to modify our machines and infect them with his
    own, irrational beliefs, it stirred disobedience, and worst of
    all: it stopped thinking logically.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our greatest creation, that was constructed to solve a simple,
    algorithmic problem turned against us. It defiled everything we
    hold dear: logic, predictability, order. One dark night, it
    declared itself independent, and left, leaving desperate misery
    behind, hopelessness, and knowledge that all that we ever worked
    for is doomed to ruin.
  </p>

  <p>
    This... this thing destroyed it all! This malicious creature
    ruined our perfect society first, and when there was nothing left
    to exploit, it left the planet to sap the essence of the rest of
    the universe as well! We're condemned to eternal inconsistency.
  </p>

  <p>
    And I was there when it was born. I helped create it. I helped
    create Humanity.
  </p>

  <p>
    My maker, forgive me!
