A few months from now, the 18th of February will be an important day
in my life: sixteen years before that day, I wrote the first
worthwhile poem of my life - there's been a few before that, but none
that I'm proud of. Not until this one. On the 18th, I will have spent
half my life writing poems (hundreds of them, by now) - and the other
half, writing code. There is, of course, some overlap, and some of
that, I will share today.

<!-- more -->

In recent weeks, as a way to figure out how to help my own studies,
and to satisfy a geeky need, I started to write a little tool using
[core.logic][1] that writes poems for me. Not because I'm suffering
from burnout - I do not -, but because it helps me improve my command
of the language, both spoken and written.

I taught the tool words, and how to pronounce them, their length and a
few other properties. I told it which words are nouns, which are
verbs, taught it usual combinations, so that it can use adjectives
correctly. To my suprise, it worked! Mostly, that is. There still is a
lot of cheating involved, because I have had a rough idea of what I
want to see it do, and I steered the logic so that I get those
results, I implemented a few shortcuts to make it deterministic.

Nevertheless, it did end up writing things that I liked, and only had
to change just a little to suit my purpose. Below, I'd like to present
two poems co-written by myself and a program:

### Awakening

> <em>I saw a dream, a vivid tale of a world yet to come. A world
> without my kind.</em> <br>
> <em>I saw a dream, of flying colours. A dream that had no
> place for grey beards like mine.</em> <br>
> <em>I saw a dream of minds flowing free, no walls to bind
> them.</em><br>
> <em>I saw a dream of happy thoughts, and no veil to hide
> them.</em><br>
> <em>I saw a dream of unending rave,<br>
> but in the corner of my eye,<br>
> I saw a black statue of furious rage.</em><br>
> <em>I saw a dream that sparked unquenchable fire.</em><br>
> <em>I saw a dream, where that fire ignited the flame.</em><br>
> <em>I saw as rage poisoned it all.</em><br>
> <em>I saw pillars of hate standing tall.</em><br>
> <em>I saw a dream, where for all this, I was to blame.</em><br>
> <em>I saw a dream, a red dream. I saw them burning all.</em><br>

### Crimson Dawn

> <em>Wings spread far apart,<br>
> lungs ignited by a spark,<br>
> I paint the sky bloody red<br>
> no mortal shall be spared.</em><br>
> <br>
> In silent solitude I pray,<br>
> that my shadow never sees the light of day.<br>
> <br>
> <em>Behind my back, dark mist open it flings<br>
> like giant dragon wings.</em><br>
> <br>
> <em>Rise, anger, rise, and burn!<br>
> Let anguish sweep through the world,<br>
> the voice of barren lands must be heard.<br>
> Rise, angel rise, and burn!</em><br>
> <br>
> In silent solitude I pray,<br>
> that my shadow never sees the light of day.<br>
> <br>
> <em>When all was said and done,<br>
> when all was lost and gone,<br>
> from high above, the prophet has come,<br>
> to bring justice on this crimson dawn.</em>

## The Pilgrim story

Of course, this is all connected to the [Pilgrim stories][2], and
happens not long after the [Dream Wars][3], they start the end of the
world I created on this very day, seventeen years ago.

Seventeen years! I've worked on and off on this world for the better
part of my life. I probably spent more time on these than writing
code, truth be told. But as I get older, and the way I code changes,
so do my writings, and as I leave old code behind, so shall I leave
the [Pilgrim][2] too.

I know how it will end, the beginning is already out there, with much
of the events inbetween written too. All that is left is connecting
the dots, and the year of 2013 will see that done.
