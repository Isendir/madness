    I have several terribly long TODO lists, and managing them in a
    sane manner is becoming a very difficult problem. I worked in a
    kanban-esque style in the past, and it wasn't all that bad (the
    tool used for it was, though), so recently, partly triggered by a
    <a href="https://twitter.com/athoshun/status/219134403853561856">tweet</a>
    from a <a href="http://athos.blogs.balabit.com/">collegue</a> I
    hold in high esteem, I started to look into using personal kanban.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, I need a tool to help me, a real board doesn't work, for
    a plethora of reasons.
  </p>
</summary>

<section>
  <h2>My use cases</h2>

  <p>
    I want something that I can use from everywhere where I can be
    online, be that from home, from work, on vacation, en route to any
    of those and whatever other strange location I may end up
    at. There's quite a lot of overlap between my work and my hobbies,
    so it makes a lot of sense to share the boards. Easily, of course.
  </p>

  <p>
    For this reason, I need something that's online, something I can
    access from anywhere. However, that is not all, not nearly. You
    see, I'm a silly person who grew up on 80x25, and I absolutely
    hate the mouse, can't stand fumbling with it aimlessly. It's not
    my thing to push, pull and toss around my own kind.
  </p>

  <p>
    So I need something that I can control reasonably well from the
    command-line too, something that has a decent API. I need this for
    setting up periodic tasks, that I want to complete each and every
    day, like reading mail. Ideally, I'd have a task called <em>Daily
    Routine</em>, with subtasks that include reading email, RSS feeds,
    and so on and so forth. I'd repeat it and complete it each day. I
    do not wish to manually set it up each time, nor do I want to drag
    it back from <strong>done</strong> (what's done is done, and must
    stay that way).
  </p>

  <p>
    I also want to work offline, from time to time, and be able to
    easily sync back.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've been looking around, but none of the solutions I found
    survived my requirements, unfortunately.
  </p>

  <h2>What I want, in short</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt> Online </dt>
    <dd> I want to access it from anywhere, anytime </dd>

    <dt> Usable from within a browser </dt>
    <dd> I like good browser-based user interfaces, and being able to
    use it from a browser means I don't need to install any special
    client software if I don't want to. </dd>

    <dt> A resonable API </dt>
    <dd> I want to automate some tasks, like creating periodic
    tasks. I don't want to use the web UI for this, nor do I require
    that the software support all my silly requirements which can be
    solved by simply having an API, and letting me do my stuff. </dd>

    <dt> Offline mode </dt>
    <dd> Sometimes I will be without connectivity, but still getting
    things done, I want to have access to the <strong>full</strong>
    software in this case too. This means, I need to be able to
    install it locally. </dd>

    <dt> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free
    software</a> </dt>
    <dd> If I have a choice, I will use free/libre software. For
    everything important, I refuse to use anything else but free
    software (hosted stuff to mirror my things to is acceptable - but
    those are mirrors). Managing my time is one of the most important
    things. </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>What will I do about it?</h2>

  <p>
    I looked around for days, but all of the possible candidates
    failed at one or more of the requirements above. Sadly, I had to
    conclude there's nothing that would satisfy my needs. And as with
    everything that bugs me, I'll go and scratch the itch, and create
    something that works for me.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will have a little time off work, and go on vacation, which will
    be a perfect time to sort out my todo/kanban needs, and develop
    the tool I desire.
  </p>

  <p>
    I plan to use git as the backend, to store tasks as directories,
    with files inside that describe the subtasks - and an index file
    for the main task itself. The daily repeating tasks would have a
    date embedded in the task filename (which could be overridden from
    the index itself). On that, I would build an API to handle the
    creation, updating and moving of tasks, with support for tracking
    time spent in various states, temporarily pausing the timer, and
    so on and so forth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once those foundations are done, I'll build a straightforward and
    easy web UI around it, and expose the API through a REST
    interface.
  </p>

  <p>
    And so far, that's all about it. In the longer run, I wish to make
    it possible to share a read-only view of some of my boards via the
    web. By design, collaboration is possible because the backend is
    git - everyone would have their own web UI, and push/pull to a
    common server. There are obvious shortcomings in a simple design
    like that, like having to poke the command-line in case there's a
    non-fast-forward merge situation, but I can live with that for
    now.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course, the result will be released under the GPL, would anyone
    else find this little hack useful. However, if one knows of any
    solution that fulfills all my requirements above, don't hesitate
    to tell me. Thanks!
