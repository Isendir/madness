    Today, during a teleconference with
    fellow <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/lumberjack/">Lumberjackers</a>,
    I got reminded that back in Brno, I wanted to write a tiny little
    library, that works as a drop-in replacement for
    the <code>syslog()</code> function in libc, but instead of
    emitting legacy syslog, uses a CEE JSON payload.

  <p>
    I spent a few hours at work, and a few hours at home ironing out
    the details, and in the end, we now have something that does
    pretty much what I want it to do, bar a few missing pieces:
    <a href="https://github.com/algernon/libumberlog">libumberlog</a>!
  </p>

  <p>
    (The project was originally called <kbd>libcee-syslog</kbd>, but was
    later renamed to <kbd>libumberlog</kbd>; and this post was updated.)
  </p>

  <p>
    It's a library that can either be used as a drop-in replacement
    for <code>syslog()</code> (via <kbd>LD_PRELOAD</kbd> or direct
    linking), and then turns legacy syslog messages into CEE-style
    stuff with a JSON payload, and also adds some automatically
    discoverable fields to the payload (such as the facility, the
    priority and the pid; with more to follow).
  </p>

  <p>
    It can also be used as a proper stand-alone library, that provides
    a slightly improved <code>syslog()</code>-style API, that allows
    one to add arbitrary key-value pairs to the payload.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the moment, the thing lacks tests, documentation and examples,
    but it's very short code, easy to understand too.
  </p>

  <p>
    But, lets see an example, for fun!
  </p>

  <div class="pygmentize" data-language="c">#include &lt;umberlog.h&gt;

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  openlog ("umberlog-test", LOG_UL_NOCACHE, LOG_LOCAL0);

  /* Legacy syslog */
  syslog (LOG_DEBUG, "hello, %s!", "algernon");

  /* Improved syslog */
  ul_syslog (LOG_DEBUG, "hello, %s!", "algernon",
             "foo", "%s", "baz",
             "baz", "bar",
             "random_number", "%d", 42,
             NULL);

  closelog ();
  return 0;
}</div>
