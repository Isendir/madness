I love Free Software, because I'm a perfectionist, and free software
allows me to hone my skills, allows others to critique my work, which
in turn allows me to learn a whole lot more - about code, about
technologies, about people, about myself. All these are invaluable by
themselves, but working with and on Free Software for the past decade
showed me that I get all these, and more. Free software makes me
happy, because I learned so much from it - and not just the code, from
the community too! It makes me happy, because I can give back, because
I see my work used, and that fills me with satisfaction.

When I began my programming career, I was blind. I wanted - I desired!
- strong control over my work, I wanted to keep the code secret. To
sell these great things I've made, and to make people wonder how on
earth I made what I made. But I was enlightened soon enough, when I
first met with GNU/Linux one early morning in the past millennia. I
saw [Perl][perl], I saw that I can read the source, that I do not need
to rely on documentation and my common sense to figure a problem out,
I can just look at how people solved the same thing, in a billion
different ways! I had access to this immense pool of knowledge, and I
felt small. I still do.

For the next few years, I learned and learned, looked at so may
software I lost count, I learned Perl, I learned C, I began to dabble
in shell, had a brief encounter with Pike, whole new horizons opened
before my eyes, as if I were staring into thousands of little
galaxies, all shining and sparkling, all connected by one single idea:
the idea that software, like information, should be free.

This was a revelation to me. There were the vast amount of knowledge
out there, I could reach out and almost touch it! I no longer had to
reinvent the wheel, I could choose the brand and the color, and still
paint my bikeshed my way too.

But that was not nearly all! Oh, no, it wasn't! For there's more to
Free Software than just the code. There are people. People a lot
smarter than me, people who love to talk and discuss their ideas even
with small pebbles like me. People who I can learn from, people who I
can look up to, people who go against the tide, and do what they feel
right.

A year after my first encounter of Free Software, I was in awe, and to
this day, this is still the case. Day by day, I'm amazed by something
new. The tremendous amount of information I consume on a daily basis
made me not only a better programmer, but a better person, a happier
person aswell: when I give back, that fills me with joy. When I see
people using software I wrote a decade ago... that is a feeling I
can't put in words.

Whenever I'm feeling down, I take a piece of code, and make it better,
then share it with the rest of the world, and knowing that I helped
make the world turn, that I contributed to a good cause, a cause that
helped me through difficult times - that makes me say that I do love
Free Software. And so should you, because knowledge is our greatest
asset, and free software helps keeping and improving our
knowledge. Cherish it, improve it, love it.
