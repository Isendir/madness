    I was contemplating switching over one of the websites I maintain
    (<a href="http://www.bajcsinagy.com/">my brother's</a>) from a
    PostgreSQL backend to one of these fancy document-stores. Now, I
    know next to nothing about these, so I started exploring, and on
    the <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> site, I found an
    <a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/172254834/mongodb-is-fantastic-for-logging">interesting
    article</a>, which praised MongoDB as being wonderful for
    logging. That made sense, and I immediately got side tracked.

    <span class="label label-important">Update!</span>

    This little hack has it's
    own <a href="/projects/syslog-ng/mongodb/">project page</a> now,
    updates will be posted there.
  </p>

  <p>
    You see, at <a href="http://www.balabit.com/">work</a>, I recently
    had to deal with logging to SQL, and it was a painful experience
    to say the least. I was curious how hard it would be to teach
    <a href="http://www.balabit.com/network-security/syslog-ng/opensource-logging-system">syslog-ng</a>
    to send logs to MongoDB.
  </p>

  <p>
    Luckily, MongoDB has
    a <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/C+Language+Center">C
    client</a>, which I based my work upon. It might not be the best
    choice, especially since I ended up embedding it, but for an alpha
    version of the destination driver, it'll do.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once I had both the C client and the syslog-ng sources, it was
    time to dive in! I already knew syslog-ng is reasonably easy to
    understand, but to be honest, I was suprised how easy it
    is. Within four hours, without any prior experience with hacking
    syslog-ng OSE, I had a fully functional MongoDB destination
    driver. Amazing!
  </p>

  <p>
    All I had to do, was copy the dummy driver, fill in the blanks
    (mostly based on the SQL driver, especially the key-value
    configuration part), and voila.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will not bore anyone with the implementation details, as it is
    available from
    the <a href="http://git.madhouse-project.org/syslog-ng/syslog-ng-3.2/log/?h=algernon/dest/mongodb">MadHouse
    git repository</a>:
  </p>

  <pre>$ git clone -b algernon/dest/mongodb \
      git://git.madhouse-project.org/syslog-ng/syslog-ng-3.2.git</pre>

  <p>
    Build and install as usual, and you're good to go. To test it, you
    will need a mongodb server; I simply used _apt-get install
    mongodb_ to obtain one. After that, one needs to configure an
    appropriate destination:
  </p>

  <pre>destination d_mongodb {
  mongodb();
};</pre>

  <p>
    This will use the default settings: connecting to localhost's
    27017 port, to the syslog-ng database, and will log the standard
    fields (date, facility, level, host, program, pid and message) to
    the "logs" collection. The same can be achieved with the following
    destination setup:
  </p>

  <pre>destination d_mongodb {
  mongodb(
    host("localhost")
    port(27017)
    database("syslog-ng")
    collection("logs")
    keys("date", "facility", "level", "host", "program", "pid", "message")
    values("${R_YEAR}-${R_MONTH}-${R_DAY} ${R_HOUR}:${R_MIN}:${R_SEC}", 
           "$FACILITY", "$LEVEL", "$HOST", "$PROGRAM", "$PID", "$MSGONLY")
  );
};</pre>

  <p>
    With this set up, we can start syslog-ng, and send some messages,
    then inspect the database:
  </p>

  <pre>$ mongo syslog-ng
MongoDB shell version: 1.4.4
url: syslog-ng
connecting to: syslog-ng
type "help" for help
&gt; db.logs.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("4d1ccab6969b9db4ccc4bb76"), "date" : "2010-12-30 19:08:54", "facility" : "user",
 "level" : "notice", "host" : "localhost", "program" : "algernon-test", "pid" : "22796",
 "message" : "Hello World!" }</pre>

  <p>
    Awesome, isn't it?
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, imagine how this can be useful when combined
    with <a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/116405435/capped-collections">capped
    collections</a>... the last few hundred logs always available to a
    web application, fast and painless, all automated, distributed and
    a lot of other buzzwords.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the version of the driver that I have here as of this
    writing, I managed to push out about <strong>17k</strong> messages
    a second on my desktop computer, which was fairly busy doing other
    stuff aswell. That's not too bad, and probably orders of
    magnitudes better than what can be accomplished with an SQL store.
  </p>

  <p>
    In any case, the code is available, and I will keep tweaking it -
    there's certainly room for improvement still. If anything
    interesting happens regarding this little toy, I will keep you
    posted.
