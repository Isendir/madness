  <p>
    I started working on the personal kanban application I
    <a href="http://asylum.madhouse-project.org/blog/2012/07/10/kanban/">wrote
    about earlier</a>, there have been a couple of changes regarding
    the implementation, and a few mockups of the user interface are
    ready to be showcased.

  <p>
    One of the major shifts in design is that the application will not
    be based on a git-backed storage. Instead, it will be built upon
    a <a href="http://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>, and tools will be
    provided to export, import and merge databases, making
    disconnected work possible.

    The way I imagine that, is that the application will have a
    replay-able log of what happend, so merging will be as easy as
    replaying the log. If conflicts arise, there'll be an API to ease
    resolving them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is to have something that's easy to deploy either
    locally, or on, say, <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">heroku</a>,
    that's one of the reasons I dropped the idea of using git as the
    storage backend. The other is that I found it unreasonably
    complicated to work with git from Clojure. On the other
    hand, <a href="http://clojuremongodb.info/">Monger</a> has been a
    great pleasure to work with so far.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have not written a single line of code yet, figuring I will
    design the user interface first, at least roughly, so I will know
    what APIs I will need to make it work. The results are below, but
    keep in mind that these are a work in progress, and I'm not a
    designer, nor an UX expert or anything.

    <h2>Screenshots</h2>

    <ul class="thumbnails">
      <li class="span4">
        <div class="thumbnail">
          <a href="/assets/asylum/images/5ms-mocks/5ms-mockup-board.png">
            <img src="/assets/asylum/images/5ms-mocks/5ms-mockup-board.360x268.png"
                 alt="5ms - board mockup">
          </a>
          <h5>Kanban board mockup</h5>
          <p>
            This is the default view, with a global timer ticking on
            the top. Some of the columns have limits, so they will
            have a danger-bar aswell.
          </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li class="span4">
        <div class="thumbnail">
          <a href="/assets/asylum/images/5ms-mocks/5ms-mockup-warning.png">
            <img src="/assets/asylum/images/5ms-mocks/5ms-mockup-warning.360x268.png"
                 alt="5ms - warning mockup">
          </a>
          <h5>Notifications</h5>
          <p>
            Some important notifications are displayed on the bottom
            (others may be displayed elsewhere, haven't decided that
            yet), they stack, and allow click-through.
          </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li class="span4">
        <div class="thumbnail">
          <a href="/assets/asylum/images/5ms-mocks/5ms-mockup-add-task.png">
            <img src="/assets/asylum/images/5ms-mocks/5ms-mockup-add-task.360x268.png"
                 alt="5ms - mockup of adding a task">
          </a>
          <h5>Adding a task</h5>
          <p>
            Adding a task pops up a dialog, where one can fill out the
            details. Editing a task will be similar, but will have a
            comments tab aswell.
          </p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>What's next?</h2>

  <p>
    Now that I have a reasonably good idea on how I want the UI to
    look like and behave (I even have a few ideas how to make it
    small-screen friendly, but more on that later!), I'll spend the
    next few days cooking up the backend. I'll have to learn to use
    ClojureScript too, as there will be more code client-side than I
    am willing to write in straight JavaScript.
