  <p>
    The commercial version
    of <a href="http://www.balabit.com/network-security/syslog-ng">syslog-ng</a>,
    called the <strong>Premium Edition</strong> offered support for
    disk buffers for a long long time now. This is something that the
    Open Source Edition is lacking even now, while there is a clear
    demand for it, and competitors support something very similar
    aswell.
  </p>

  <p>
    While I won't go into the whys, let me explain a few ideas people
    came up with to implement disk buffers, their shortcomings, and
    plans currently in motion that will ease the task in the not too
    distant future.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>The Goal</h2>

  <p>
    The goal we want to accomplish, is to have a reliable way of
    storing messages that are still <em>in flight</em>, being
    processed by syslog-ng, on disk. There are two reasons we'd like
    to do this:

    <ol>
      <li>
        To ensure that messages do not get lost, not even when
        syslog-ng unexpectedly stops
      </li>

      <li>
        To have a larger buffer for peaks, when storing all pending
        messages in memory would be unfeasible.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h2>The problem</h2>

  <p>
    The main issue at hand is not only that syslog-ng OSE does not
    have a disk buffer, but that it's very far from trivial to add
    this feature to it. And that is because the message queue system
    in OSE is not as extensible as it is in PE: you can't just hook in
    a disk buffering system and live happily ever after.
  </p>

  <p>
    Would that be the case, OSE would already have a disk buffer
    solution, as coding up a simple one is about a day's worth of
    work.
  </p>

  <h2>The workarounds</h2>

  <h3>Use a buffer file!</h3>

  <p>
    One of the first things people think of is: "<em>What if I write
    to a file, and use that as the source for another
    destination?</em>". This could be as simple as:
  </p>

  <blockquote><pre>source s_network { tcp(flags(no-parse)); udp(flags(no-parse)); };
destination d_buffer { file("/var/cache/syslog-ng/buffer.log"
                       template("$MESSAGE\n")); };
log { source(s_network); destination(d_buffer); };

source s_buffer { file("/var/cache/syslog-ng/buffer.log"
                       follow-freq(0.1)); };
destination d_net { tcp("1.2.3.4"); };
log { source(s_buffer); destination(d_net); };</pre></blockquote>

  <p>
    This has a few drawbacks, however.

    <ul>
      <li> The buffer will grow indefinitely. </li>
      <li> The buffer will need to be frequently polled to keep latency low. </li>
      <li> The configuration is far longer than one would want it to be. </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Use a buffer file, with rotation!</h3>

  <p>
    To solve the issue of the file growing forever and ever, we could,
    of course, rotate it away from time to time. But what would we
    gain from that? Two new problems!
  </p>

  <p>
    We still can't expire old files, not easily, not reliably anyway,
    as we do not know which files have been fully consumed by
    the <em>s_buffer</em> source.
  </p>

  <p>
    And, we added extra complexity to the config, because we now have
    a large number of buffer files, and we need to figure out when to
    start polling new ones. If we use an external rotation mechanism,
    we could SIGHUP syslog-ng after tweaking the config to use the new
    file, but then we have a window where messages in the old buffer
    haven't been processed yet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Or we could use wildcard sources (once they're ported from PE to
    OSE), which makes the following of buffer files easy:
  </p>

  <blockquote><pre>destination d_buffer { file("/var/cache/syslog-ng/buffer-${HOUR}.log"
                            template("$MESSAGE\n")); };
source s_buffer { file("/var/cache/syslog-ng/buffer-*.log"
                       follow-freq(0.1)); };</pre></blockquote>

  <p>
    However, we still can't expire old files reliably, as we have no
    way of knowing when a buffer was wholly consumed.
  </p>

  <h3>Lets parse <tt>syslog-ng.persist</tt>!</h3>

  <p>
    Thankfully for us, syslog-ng stores what position it is standing
    at for all files it is using as a source. We just need a way to
    get that out of the persist file. Sadly, no tool exists yet that
    would allow us to do so.
  </p>

  <p>
    Technically, if we could figure out the file position from the
    persist file, and we'd have wildcard sources, implementing
    disk-buffers would only take a couple of lines, and a cron job to
    clean up old stuff: find all files that are read fully and are
    older than a set limit, like, if it's twice as old as the rotation
    interval, then it is a candidate for deletion.
  </p>

  <h2>Can we do better?</h2>

  <p>
    While the above solution will work nicely, that too, has a few
    drawbacks: it's hacky, it needs longer configuration than one
    would ideally want, and it needs an external tool to clean up old
    buffer files. We can surely do better than that!
  </p>

  <p>
    To do better, we need a way to extend - or replace - the queue
    mechanism used within syslog-ng. Doing this properly is a hard
    task, but most of it has been done already, it just needs to
    migrate from PE to OSE - a question of time and energy, really. I
    won't go into more details about this right now, as
    it <strong>will</strong> happen, and as far as the disk queues are
    concerned, it's not important to know how the queue
    extending/replacing system works under the hood.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, for a moment, lets imagine that we already have a pluggable
    queue system, ok? We can completely replace the queues syslog-ng
    uses internally.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, take a step back, and think about what we use the queue
    system for: to pass messages around. Does that sound familiar? Of
    course it does. Let's use a message queue then! Preferably one
    that already supports disk buffering,
    like <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com//">RabbitMQ</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we'd replace syslog-ng's queue mechanism with such a queue
    system, we wouldn't only gain disk buffers, but a host of other
    interesting things too, but that is for a different post. For now,
    lets see how a rabbitmq-based config would look like:
  </p>

  <blockquote><pre>options {
  queue(rabbitmq);
  rabbitmq(durable(yes)
           delivery(persistent));
};

source s_net { tcp(); udp(); };
destination d_net { tcp(); };
log { source(s_net); destination(d_net); };</pre></blockquote>

  <p>
    And that's about it. "<em>Where's the disk queue size?</em>" - you
    may ask, and rightfully so! Well, we replaced syslog-ng's internal
    queue mechanism with rabbitmq, so <em>log_fifo_size()</em> is now
    the number of messages a particular queue will hold. There's no
    separate disk buffer size setting in this case, as that's entirely
    handled by RabbitMQ.
  </p>

  <h3>When will we have all this?</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Wildcard source is already written, although it needs to be
      ported (and potentially rewritten in the process) from PE to
      OSE, it's entirely possible to get this done for syslog-ng 3.4.
    </li>

    <li>
      A tool to inspect persist files has been requested multiple
      times, but currently, there is no active effort on writing such
      a tool - help is, of course, welcome in this area. Nevertheless,
      implementing as much of this as we'd need for buffer file
      rotation is likely a very easy task, and as such, can be done in
      syslog-ng 3.4 too.
    </li>

    <li>
      Extending the queue mechanism is available in PE, but I'd want
      something more: to replace the whole queuing system. That's a
      huge task, and it won't be coming soon. It is very unlikely that
      I'll start working on this before 3.5 opens up for development.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To put it otherwise, the slightly hackish, not so nice solution is
    entirely possible to do within the scope of syslog-ng 3.4. The
    most powerful solution, that also buys us a whole host of neat
    things along with disk buffering, is something that will have to
    wait.
  </p>

  <h3>Can we help?</h3>

  <p>
    Of course! If you have some experience writing C code, then a
    persist file inspection tool likely won't be a huge challenge for
    you - and I am always happy to help and give hints.
  </p>

  <p>
    But even if you're not a coder-type, or simply lack the time,
    expressing your interest, and showing support for our efforts of
    making syslog-ng better and better is also greatly appreciated!
