        Dancing on a thin line<br>
        A hop, a jump: the crowd cheers as I land<br>
        Lady Luck gave me another hand<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Dancing on a thin line, I see<br>
          An angel, a fairy, the Beauty herself,<br>
          Her fall into the fiery pits of Hell</strong><br>
        <br>
        Dancing on a thin line<br>
        A wrong step, I stumble and fall<br>
        Will I be welcomed to the heavenly hall?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Dancing on a thin line, I saw<br>
          The most beautiful girl of them all.<br>
          I watched her shine, I watched her fall,<br>
          Her body lying on the floor.<br>
          Dancing on a thin line, I saw<br>
          The gentle instruments of fate,<br>
          A man overcome by jealousy and hate</strong><br>
        <br>
        Dancing a on a thin line, we saw<br>
        A knot that made us famous, forever more.<br>
