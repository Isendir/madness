Half a lifetime ago, somewhere at the end of the last millennia I
became a free software enthusiast. On and off, I've been working on
Free Software for the past fifteen years - most of them unknown,
discontinued by now; a huge part of this work was a hobby: small,
infrequent contributions. But it was, and still is, something I enjoy
doing, something that satisfies my hunger for knowledge, my desire to
give back to the community I received so much from. Over the years,
what originally started as a desire became a need. What started as a
preference, became a requirement. And all through these years, I had a
dream, a clear goal I wanted to achieve, which gave purpose to a lot
of things I wrote and worked on.

This past Monday, the goal was reached. I left the [BalaBit][balabit]
support department this week, and went for greener pastures, to do
what I wanted to do since I became a free software fanatic: work on
free software for a living. As of July first, I'm officially a
[syslog-ng OSE][sng-ose] developer, working full time on 100% Free
Software. And not just any software, but something used by millions
all over the world. For the first time in my life, I am able to do
what I want, for a living.

So how did I end up here?

It all started on a boring night in December, 2010, when I wrote the
first version of the [mongodb destination][mongodb-announce], which
also marks my entrance into the syslog-ng contributor scene (apart
from a set of bugfixes I was doing in my role as a software engineer
at support). From this grew an agreement between the support and
development departments (and myself, of course), that I can
[spend 20% of my time][20-percent] working on syslog-ng OSE. For a
while, I spent my Fridays doing just that, eventually obtaining
another hat: [maintaining the 3.3 stable branch][ann-mnt], and later
the [3.4 branch too][ann-3.4]. Meanwhile, the 20% percent was
reconsidered, and became 50%, with the premise that it will become
100% in the not too distant future. That future is now.

That future is now, and while there will be a slower ramp-up time,
there are great things in store, of which, I'll talk about in a later
post. Needless to say, though, even if I achieved a dream, there are
other desires to pursue, and I'm not going to spend fifteen years
achieving them: it's time to fire up the rocket boots, and see where
they take me.

Two years. Watch this place.
