    There is a growing interest in
    getting <a href="http://syslog-ng.com/opensource-logging-system/">syslog-ng</a>
    to log to <a href="http://www.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a>, and there
    is not a single howto out there that would explain the various
    bits and pieces of the configuration.
  </p>

  <p>
    For some, reading the source or asking on
    the <a href="https://lists.balabit.hu/mailman/listinfo/syslog-ng">mailing
    list</a> works, for the rest, read on!

<section>
  <p>
    In this document, I will be talking about syslog-ng 3.4, the
    development version as of this writing. However, most of it
    applies to the current stable, 3.3, too, and these differences
    will be aptly highlighted.
  </p>

  <p>
    The basic configuration that works right out of the box, remained the
    same:
  </p>

  <pre>destination d_mongodb {
  mongodb();
}</pre>

  <p>
    This uses the default configuration, which is:
  </p>

  <pre>destination d_mongodb {
  mongodb(
    servers("localhost:27017") # Replaces the host() & port() options of 3.3
    database("syslog")
    collection("messages")
    safe-mode(no) # Not supported by 3.3!
    value-pairs(scope("selected-macros" "nv-pairs"))
  );
};</pre>

  <p>
    All of the options should be self explanatory, I believe: you can
    list multiple <em>host:port</em> pairs in the <tt>servers()</tt>
    option (but the <tt>host()</tt> and <tt>port()</tt> options from
    3.3 continue to work, for compability's sake),
    and <tt>safe-mode()</tt> can be toggled on and off, as one would
    expect. The most interesting part of the configuration is
    <tt>value-pairs()</tt> no doubt, that setting controls what gets
    into the database, and in what format.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is not strictly tied to the MongoDB destination (the JSON
    template function uses it too, under the hood, for example), but
    this is a great opportunity to explain what the setting can do for
    you, and how various common tasks can be accomplished with its
    help.
  </p>

  <h2>Value pairs<hr></h2>

  <p>
    The basic idea behind <tt>value-pairs()</tt> is that it allows one to
    control which key-value pairs shall be considered for use. Think
    of it like a <tt>SELECT</tt> in ye olde SQL, just done our way.
  </p>

  <h3>The basics<hr></h3>

  <p>
    As a first step, one needs to select a default <tt>scope()</tt>, which can
    be a combination of any of the following:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>
      <em>base</em>, <em>core</em>,
      or <em>rfc3164</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      This scope contains all the keys that are part of a normal,
      legacy syslog
      message: <em>FACILITY</em>, <em>PRIORITY</em>, <em>HOST</em>,
      <em>PROGRAM</em>, <em>PID</em>, <em>MESSAGE</em>
      and <em>DATE</em>.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      <em>syslog-proto</em>, or <em>rfc5424</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      This scope contains all the keys of the new syslog-protocol,
      which is to say, all of the keys from the base, along with
      <em>MSGID</em>.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      <em>selected-macros</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Contains the <em>TAGS</em>, <em>SOURCEIP</em>
      and <em>SEQNUM</em> macros on top of the core set.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      <em>all-macros</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      This is a scope for all macros - it is rarely useful, so I'm not
      going to go into detail.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      <em>sdata</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      As the name implies, is for all SDATA (of rfc5424 fame) keys. If
      you have sources that send logs with embedded SDATA, this is the
      scope you want, if you want to log these.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      <em>nv-pairs</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Refers to all keys that are set one way or the other: through
      patterndb, csvparser, json-parser or manually. This does not
      include keys starting with a dot - syslog-ng treats those as
      internal.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      <em>dot-nv-pairs</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Is the scope for the rest of the name-value pairs: the ones
      beginning with a dot.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      <em>all-nv-pairs</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      This scope is a combination of the previous two.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      <em>everything</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Needless to say, this scope includes everything, and is a
      combination of all of the above.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
    The scope determines the base set - but you can add new keys to
    it, or even exclude. The <tt>key()</tt> and <tt>exclude()</tt>
    options are the ways to accomplish this, both take a glob-pattern
    (in 3.4; 3.3 does not support globs in the <tt>key()</tt> option,
    only exact key names), and will add in, or exclude any key that
    matches that set. These are evaluated in order, so if you first
    exclude something, and a subsequent statement adds it back, it
    will be back - or the other way around. However,
    the <tt>scope()</tt> is always evaluated first, regardless of
    where it appears in the config.
  </p>

  <p>
    A special version of <tt>key()</tt> is the <tt>pair()</tt> option,
    with which one can add any value (where the value can be specified
    as a template, with all the bells and whistles that supports:
    macros, template functions and the rest) under pretty much any
    name - but unlike the value, the name is a string, not a template.
  </p>

  <p>
    Armed with this knowledge, we can control very well what gets sent
    to the database in the end. Let us see an example!
  </p>

  <p>
    Lets suppose we have a very verbose, horribly overstructured JSON
    input, which we parse with the JSON parser, and want to log the
    useful parts of it to MongoDB. This source of ours would look
    somewhat like this:
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">{ "DATE": "2012-04-26 14:19:20",
  "SOURCE": {
    "HOST": "localhost",
    "IFACE": "lo",
    "PROGRAM": {
      "NAME": "test-program",
      "PID": 1234
    },
    "CREDENTIALS": {
      "UID": 1000,
      "GID": 1000
    },
  },
  "FACILITY": "user",
  "PRIORITY": "info",
  "MESSAGE": "this is a test message!",
  "META": {
    "GENERATED_BY": "test-program v1.0",
    "ADVERTISEMENT": "This log message was brought to you by test-program v1.0 enterprise",
    "COPYRIGHT": "(C) 2012 BigBadCompany",
    "LICENSE": "WTFPL 1.0"
  }
}</pre>


  <p>
    This obviously has useful parts, but we don't want to keep the
    same structure, nor all parts of it. So lets say we want some
    standard stuff, like
    the <em>DATE</em>, <em>HOST</em>, <em>PROGRAM</em>, <em>PID</em>,
    <em>FACILITY</em>, <em>PRIORITY</em> and <em>MESSAGE</em> fields
    only, and not the rest, and all of these on the top level. How
    would we do that with value-pairs?
  </p>

  <p>
    We'll start with an empty scope, and build from there:
  </p>

  <pre>value-pairs(
  key("DATE") key("FACILITY") key("PRIORITY") key("MESSAGE")
  pair("HOST" "${SOURCE.HOST}")
  pair("PROGRAM" "${SOURCE.PROGRAM.NAME}")
  pair("PID" "$(SOURCE.PROGRAM.PID}")
)</pre>

  <p>
    And that's about it! It's important to keep in mind, that
    explicitly defining a <tt>pair()</tt> with a custom value will
    overwrite the value of the given key if it existed before. This
    can be used to override fields of the default scope, for example.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now lets say we want to add the <em>META</em> too, but not the
    advertisement. This only needs one more line added to the
    <tt>value-pairs()</tt> block above:
  </p>

  <pre>key("META.*") exclude("META.ADVERTISEMENT")</pre>

  <p>
    Now, if we wanted to add the credentials info too, we'd soon start
    to wonder: isn't there an easier way to do that? Must I list all
    these keys explicitly?
  </p>

  <h3>Transformations<hr></h3>

  <p>
    This is where transformations come in: a very powerful feature in
    syslog-ng 3.4, with which one can apply any number of
    transformations to key names: we can shift the key to the right,
    we can add prefixes, or replace a string prefix with another.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without much further ado, let me show an example that will transform
    the above structure into this:
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">{ "DATE": "2012-04-26 14:19:20",
  "HOST": "localhost",
  "PROGRAM": "test-program",
  "PID": 1234
  "CREDENTIALS": {
    "UID": 1000,
    "GID": 1000
  },
  "FACILITY": "user",
  "PRIORITY": "info",
  "MESSAGE": "this is a test message!",
  "META": {
    "GENERATED_BY": "test-program v1.0",
    "COPYRIGHT": "(C) 2012 BigBadCompany",
    "LICENSE": "WTFPL 1.0"
  }
}</pre>

  <p>
    And the magic value-pairs invocation to do this:
  </p>

  <pre>value-pairs(
  key("DATE") key("FACILITY") key("PRIORITY") key("MESSAGE")
  key("SOURCE.*" rekey(shift(7)))
  exclude("PROGRAM.*")
  pair("PROGRAM" "${SOURCE.PROGRAM.NAME}")
  pair("PID" "${SOURCE.PROGRAM.PID}")
  key("META.*") exclude("META.ADVERTISEMENT")
)</pre>

  <p>
    Lets suppose we want to restructure things a bit, and
    move <em>FACILITY</em> and <em>PRIORITY</em> under
    the <em>syslog.</em>  prefix. Since those two are the only keys
    that end with <tt>ITY</tt>, we can use a glob:
  </p>

  <pre>key("*ITY" rekey(add-prefix("syslog.")))</pre>

  <p>
    And to showcase the third available key transformer function, lets
    say we want to replace <em>META</em> with <em>COPYRIGHT</em>! We
    could do this with <tt>shift()</tt> and <tt>add-prefix()</tt>, but
    there's a shortcut:
  </p>

  <pre>key("META.*" rekey(replace("META" "COPYRIGHT")))</pre>

  <p>
    You might wonder now, though, why transformations are useful, when
    the dance we need to do to get things into shape (and still use
    <tt>exclude()</tt> and <tt>pair()</tt> for <em>PROGRAM</em>
    and <em>PID</em>!) is longer than if we listed keys by hand. Why,
    then?
  </p>

  <p>
    The reason is simple: transformations allow you to transform all
    keys matching a glob, so if you receive a message where there are
    more stuff under a key than what you thought of earlier, the
    transformation will still catch it. If we extend the <em>META</em>
    structure with a few more fields, and want to rename them all to
    <em>COPYRIGHT</em>, with transformations, that's doable - with
    explicitly listing keys, not so much.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusions<hr></h2>

  <p>
    And with the above, we pretty much covered everything that's
    possible with the MongoDB destination and value-pairs. Have fun,
    and happy logging!
