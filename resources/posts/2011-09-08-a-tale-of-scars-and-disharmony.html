    A winter's night it was, when the first rays of the dawn started
    to pierce through the forest. On the icy lake among the trees, one
    could almost see a faint figure, as she was skating on the
    surface:  sometimes gently, like if she didn't even touch the ice,
    sometimes so hard as if she was melting the ice on behalf of the
    rising sun.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, a tall, dark figure was rapidly approaching through the
    woods.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ice was melting, the previous day weakened it already, it was
    a wonder it lasted so long as it is. Then it yielded, right under
    Her feet. Her terrified scream echoed through the surrounding
    mountains, and the dark figure began to run.

  <p>
    He threw away his cape, and dived under to find the girl. Find
    her, he did, but she was frozen through, the spark of life barely
    flickering in her heart. He took her in his arms, wrapped his warm
    cape around her, and headed towards the fisherman's cave.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was the first time he looked at her, and for a moment, he
    stood dumbfolded: it was an Angel he held in his arms. His heart
    began to race, to pound and roar like a trapped bear. Her face,
    he'll never forget.
  </p>

  <p>
    Shortly, he arrived, and the fisherman and his wife took the girl
    inside. The dark figure just stood there, thinking. Then he took
    his cape, and left without even looking back.
