    Recently, the issue
    of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement">Contributor
    License Agreements</a> came up again on various
    forums, <a href="http://lwn.net/">LWN</a> included,
    when <a href="http://harmonyagreements.org/">Project Harmony</a>
    launched in, I think, June, and
    now <a href="http://hpccsystems.com/community/white-papers/the_covenant_bperens">The
    Covenant</a>, a proposal by Bruce Perens appeared.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, I have a fundamental issue with both approaches...

  <p>
    Though, I must say, that I do agree
    with <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/458523/">one of Perens'
    comments</a> over at
    <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/458523/">LWN</a>: <a href="http://harmonyagreements.org/">Harmony</a>
    misses the point, by a mile.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anyway, the major reason I prefer the GPL over any other license
    is because of its viral nature, that it goes to great lengths to
    try and assure that once something is Free Software, it will
    remain so. CLAs defeat that purpose. They allow a loophole to do
    things with <em>my</em> code that the original license would not
    permit. I don't like that.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a GPL zealot, thus, when I contribute to a GPL'd program (and
    most CLAs are made with the GPL in mind, as most of the other open
    source licenses do permit non-free reuse), I bloody well want my
    code to be mine, so if one ever wants to relicense it, or use it
    in a way the GPL would not permit, I will have a say in it aswell
    (and my answer will be a very harsh and
    strong <strong>NO</strong>).
  </p>

  <p>
    Having to sign a CLA defeats the entire purpose of my contribution
    under a GPL (or, for that matter, any other) license. Even with
    <a href="http://hpccsystems.com/community/white-papers/the_covenant_bperens">The
    Covenant</a>, the requirements of the original license are not
    guaranteed to be met at any particular point in the far future,
    therefore, it still misses the point, although sligltly less
    than <a href="http://harmonyagreements.org/">Harmony</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    While I did sign a CLA or two in the past (which, a few years
    later, I regret, and wouldn't do now), for many reasons, including
    the ones above, I will never sign another again. Copyright
    assignment to the appropriate entity (such as
    the <a href="http://fsf.org/">FSF</a>) - sure! But otherwise, the
    code is mine, I contributed it under a specific license, and I
    want it to stay that way, otherwise I don't see the point of the
    license.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thankfully, none of the projects I contribute to nowadays require
    a CLA, so I don't have to maintain any larger patchsets on my own.
