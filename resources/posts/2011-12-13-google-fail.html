    A few simple mistakes you should not make as a recruiter if you're
    trying to get a positive response out of me (even if that positive
    response is only as positive as a respectful "<em>No, thank
    you</em>"):

  <ul>
    <li>
      You should not email me at my work address (which is very
      publicly listed as a work address in multiple places all over
      the place, including the recruiting
      company's <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/116945904339060122801/about">own
      services</a>) and then mention confidentiality.
    </li>
    <li>
      You should not email four of my email addresses at the same
      time, one of which has been inactive and bouncing for seven
      years.
    </li>
    <li>
      You should not email me after I ignored similar inquiries from
      you in the not too distant past.
    </li>
    <li>
      You should not email me after I respectfully declined before,
      and asked not to be contacted again.
    </li>
    <li>
      You should not repeat all of the above <strong>again</strong>,
      only 3 months later.
    </li>
  </ul>

    Dear Google,
    and <a href="https://plus.google.com/109450825462962601576/">Sarah
    Grimaldi</a> in particular, you failed at all five,
    congratulations!
  </p>

  <p>
    So, here's a public request: do not email me ever again about job
    opportunities within Google. I do not wish to work for Google. Not
    now, not tomorrow, not ever.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you.
