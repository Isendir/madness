The [Google Summer of Code 2014][gsoc2014] programme reached another
milestone recently: the accepted proposals were
[published][gsoc2014:proposal-accept], and over a thousand students
were selected by nearly two hundred mentoring organisations, among
them the [syslog-ng project][sng]. We will be working with four
students this year (twice we worked with last year), with more
mentors, on a wider selection of projects. It was a tough decision to
select the proposals, we received some very strong work this year.

We would like to express our gratitude to both [Debian][debian], for
giving us an extra slot (so we could accept four students instead of
three), and Google and Carol Smith in particular, for allowing it, and
putting up with our fumbling during the process.
