I'm proud to announce - two days later on this blog - the result of
about eight months of development [syslog-ng][sng] version
[3.5.1][351-release]! This is the first stable release from the 3.5
branch, the successor of the 3.3 branch, which was originally released
earlier this year, in February. This is the second time I oversee a
first major release, but it still feels intimidating. Although, this
time it went much smoother than the last time. The 3.5.1 release is
also very interesting for a number of reasons: not only do we have
very interesting features, we also have more code contributed by the
community, a succesful merge of a GSoC project, and a faster
development cycle to boot!

I already wrote an [article about upcoming features][cooking], so I
will not go into detail about the features already mentioned there.
Nevertheless, the list of new things is fairly long:
[multi-line support][cooking:ml], [STOMP destination][cooking:stomp],
[Redis destination](#f:redis),
[template type-hinting][cooking:type-hinting],
[unit suffixes in the config][cooking:unit-suffix],
[new template functions][cooking:template-funcs], and the existence of
the [Incubator project][incubator].

<!-- more -->

Of course, not everything was documented in the previous post, the
[redis destination](#f:redis) was not merged yet at the time, and the
Riemann destination ended up being part of the [Incubator][incubator]
instead of the master tree. Lets look at Redis, and then some nice
numbers afterwards!

## <a name="f:redis" href="#f:redis">Redis destination</a>

Developed during the [Google Summer of Code 2013][gsoc2013] program,
this destination driver makes it possible to easily send commands to a
[Redis server](http://redis.io/), an advanced key-value store (or data
structure server). Using it is fairly simple:

 [gsoc2013]: http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2013/tichy/27001

<pre>redis(
 host("localhost")
 port(6369)

 command("HINCRBY", "hosts", "$HOST", 1)
);</pre>

## The Incubator project

The syslog-ng module incubator (Incubator henceforth) is a collection
of tools and modules for syslog-ng that for one reason or the other,
are not part of the official repository. This serves both as a staging
ground for experimental modules, and as a repository of plugins that
are not aimed at upstream inclusion. It's also an example of a third
party syslog-ng module.

## Contributors!

Compared to the [first commit on the 3.5 branch][3.5-first], a total
of **346** patches have been committed, producing the following
diffstat:

>  372 files changed, 17948 insertions(+), 8396 deletions(-)

That's half the pathces and half the lines modified than in the 3.4
development cycle, which, I believe is a good thing. Faster, smaller,
more stable releases are good for everybody.

I would hereby like to thank all the people who contributed to
syslog-ng's development in one form or another, be that patches, bug
reports, testing or anything else: Fabien Wernli, Balazs Scheidler,
