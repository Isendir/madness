    Every legend has a beginning, and everything that ever existed,
    that ever began, always comes to an end.

  <blockquote><p><i>Some pass away with fanfare,<br>
        buried in a timeless lair,<br>
        some quietly disappear,<br>
        ingenious and sincere.<br></i></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    And so has the Master gone, to places beyond mortal comprehension,
    his garden left behind to forever grow.
  </p>

  <blockquote><p><i>A spark of life beneath the earth,<br>
        a sprig of green, of joy and mirth,<br>
        a new tree born upon the grave:<br>
        an oak of love, of wisdom, of rave.<br></i></p>
  </blockquote>

    Many have tried to carve a few words onto his headstone, to pay
    respect, but all poems disappeared overnight, until one day, The
    Pilgrim wrote these words upon the wood:
  </p>

  <blockquote><p><i>When the Night, onto a rotten log, a new face he paints,<br>
        this last work of her love, the Dusk, as disguise she takes,<br>
        His knees tremble, His head turns grey and He dies.<br>
        Poor Dusk, under the mask she cries,<br>
        but mortals with eyes shut tight,<br>
        only see Dawn smiling bright.<br></i></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    And from the ashes of Master Wall, a new legend begins: that of
    <a href="/blog/tags/the-pilgrim/">The Pilgrim</a>. A tale of scars
    and disharmony - another side of the same story.
