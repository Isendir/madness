When I [switched][switch] my site from Octopress to my own creation,
I also had to do the design all over. I liked it, but there were a
couple of things I wasn't satisfied with, so between two study
sessions, I rearranged things a bit, as you can clearly see now. I'll
try to summarize the most important changes, and why they were made,
if for nothing else, as a reminder to myself for the next time I have
to design a website.

Lets look at the old and the new design side by side for a start!

With the new design, I had a couple of goals I wanted to achieve.

### Less distraction

The old design had a sidebar on every single page, and that took quite
a lot of space, and didn't look all that well on smaller resolutions
either. For this reason, the sidebar is gone, its contents are
available from the menubar at the top, in form of three dropdowns: the
*Social*, *Tags* and *Recent posts* items replace the sidebar.

The tag list of every post have been rethought aswell: they're now
plain links, and not buttons (therefore, they don't stand out as
prominently); they were also moved - along with the post's date - to
the top of the box, just below the title. This way, tags and post
dates line up nicely, just like the titles.

The number of recent posts displayed on the front page was also cut in
half, because much older posts were just taking up the space, and
forced a scrollbar far sooner than necessary. On the other hand, in
the *Recent posts* menu, there are still six posts available.

The new design also has less icons all over. While icons are a great
tool, the old theme overused them slightly. Another change that was
made to make the design easier for the eye was that links are not
underlined anymore, but a different color is used for them. This also
allows me to use underlined text in my posts - which I haven't felt
the need for yet, but still!

### Less is more

With the demise of the sidebar, the new theme has lots more horizontal
space, but there are other changes that - I hope - will improve the
usability of the site:

* Tags are sorted alphabetically now, instead of being pretty much
  randomly scattered over the sidebar.
* The date of a post is now also a link to that year's archives, so
  the archives are easier to browse.
* The *previous* and *next* links under a post were switched, so they
  match the sorting order used elsewhere on the site.
* Comments were turned off for most pages and posts: they weren't used
  much, yet, took up a significant amount of space. On the few posts
  where they were left enabled, they're collapsed by default.
* The font was replaced too, because the old one wasn't the most
  readable thing (and with *l*, *i*, *!* and a couple of other glyphs
  looking very much alike, it was downright painful).
* Even the most recent post has its date and tags displayed now.

### A more pleasant theme

While I did like the old design, there were a few mistakes I made with
it, which seemed like a good idea at first, but I quickly grew tired
of them. Among these are the *wells*, the darker box in which the main
content was wrapped in. It was distracting, and it was painful to have
similar highlighting within a post. It was also fairly pointless too:
on the index page, the most recent post was highlighted enough by
being thrice as wide as the posts in the recent posts area; on other
pages, there were no other posts shown, so highlighting the current
one was needless there too.

Another mistake was the overuse of colors and icons, about which I
already talked about above. Nevertheless, hovering over links changed
their color, which was more distracting than it needed to be: in the
new design, the color remains the same, the link gets underlined on
hover instead.

### The result

The result, I believe, is a compact theme, where the most accessed
things are easily available, while everything else is still there,
neatly contained in non-distracting places. There are of course a few
issues that need to be fixed or improved still, like the menu not
being all that friendly on mobile and touchscreen devices, but I'll
get there, eventually.
