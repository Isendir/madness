Having spent almost a year fine-tuning my latest [`~/.emacs.d`][gh:emacs.d], an
innocent question from a colleague triggered a long chain of events, that led to
dropping my entire Emacs config, and migrating to [Spacemacs][gh:spacemacs]
instead. It has a whole lot of interesting features, but for me, the most
important one was the mnemonic key bindings: this is something I wanted to do
for a long time, but never managed to force myself to sit down and do it. Now I
don't have to, Spacemacs does it for me.

The downside? Well, modal editing is strange still. Not sure I like it, but it
certainly does make a few things more convenient. And since I still have all the
power of Emacs under my fingertips, I might even get used to this.

I like the modeline, and that the editor stays out of my way even more than it
did before. Clean, functional, and most of it is not maintained by me.
