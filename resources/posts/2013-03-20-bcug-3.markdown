Our [small community][bcug] seems to be growing nicely: on our
[first meetup][first-bcug], hardly any drinks were consumed, and we
nicely fit into the lecture room at [BalaBit][balabit]. On the
[second meetup][second-bcug], popcorn disappeared before I could
blink. On our [third meetup][third-bcug], we barely fit into the
room. For the fourth, we'll have to move the meetup to a bigger room
(the Auditorium). I'm very happy with the meetups so far, although the
last one became a little bit more experimental than originally
planned. I found it fun, nevertheless, and also learned quite a bit
about how future meetups shall be organised. Also, for the first time
in the history of the [Budapest Clojure User Group][bcug], we have not
only pictures, but we have a video recording too (soon to be available
on a youtube near you)! While we still had to fight various
non-clojurian technologies to get this far, and the quality of the
recording ain't stellar either, it is progress nevertheless. We're
slowly improving in this area too, and I'm confident than sooner
rather than later, we'll have not only solved the problem of producing
high quality recording, but that of streaming it live too.

Regarding the last event itself, it was experimental in at least two
ways: first, this was the first ever live coding I ever did, and I
used [LightTable][lighttable] instead of my trusty old Emacs. Turns
out that these two didn't mix all that well, and perhaps I should've
experimented with one thing at a time.

While LightTable is a very promising IDE, it's nowhere near yet, it
does not have all the features I would expect from an environment
ready for live-coding. I had trouble copy & pasting blocks, even
within the same tab, let alone between them. The only kind of
copy-paste that worked is from outside applications into
LightTable.. this was kind of embarassing and unexpected. But I
should've tried it at home while preparing. On the other hand, the
insta-repl was great, except when the error messages kept popping up
at silly places, and my editor jumped about too... but thankfully that
happened only once or twice. A bigger problem than LightTable was that
I was fighting with the flu the past weekend, and still have not
recovered fully, and that sadly had an ill effect on both how much I
could prepare, and how well I could get it accross. Not to mention
that I ended up sounding like Darth Vader on a gramophone by the time
I got home.

But despite all this, I liked this last event too, there were amazing
questions asked during the session, very good feedback given - thank
you all! I'm looking forward to the next event, which will be held on
the 23rd of April, keep an eye on the [meetup page][bcug]!
