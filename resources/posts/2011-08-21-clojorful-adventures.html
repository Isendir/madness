    <a href="http://algernon.blogs.balabit.com/2011/08/clojuration/">Earlier</a>,
    on my <a href="http://algernon.blogs.balabit.com/">work blog</a> I
    mused about a simple <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>
    function, that trims a string at word boundaries (more or less),
    and compared it to <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a> and
    Python code. Today, I will revisit the same code here, and fix a
    little bug in it.
  </p>

<section>
  <p>
    For reference, here's how the original Clojure function looked like:
  </p>

  <div class="pygmentize" data-language="clojure">(defn trim-at-boundary [string max-len]
  (if (&lt; (.length string) max-len)
    string
    (str (s/take
          (reduce #(if (&lt; (+ (.length %1) (.length %2) 1) (- max-len 3))
                     (str %1 " " %2) %1)
                  (s/split string #"\s"))
          (- max-len 3))
         " ...")))</div>

  <p>
    Do notice the subtle bug in the reduce function:
  </p>

  <div class="pygmentize" data-language="clojure">(if (&lt; (+ (.length %1) (.length %2) 1) (- max-len 3))
       (str %1 " " %2) %1)</div>

  <p>
    The intention was to stop reducing when our result would overflow,
    but this reduction function doesn't do that: it does not stop
    then! If any words past the point we should be trimming at is
    short enough to still fit into the limit, it will be appended to
    the list.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is unfortunate, as the result will have garbage at the end.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a workaround, we can pass the first argument as a list, the
    first part of it being the word, the second a boolean, that marks
    whether we should continue reducing, or not. The result of the
    reduce will be a two-element list aswell, but we just take its
    head, and we're good to go!
  </p>

  <p>
    In the end, the result looks like this:
  </p>

  <div class="pygmentize" data-language="clojure">(defn trim-at-boundary
  [string max-len]
  (if (&lt; (.length string) max-len)
    string
    (let [words (s/split string #"\s"), stop-len (- max-len 3)]
      (str (s/take
            (first (reduce
                    #(let [[a finished] %1, b %2]
                       (if (or finished
                               (&gt;= (+ (.length a) (.length b) 1) stop-len))
                         (list a true)
                         (list (str a " " b) false)))
                    (list (first words) false) (rest words)))
            stop-len)
           "..."))))</div>

  <p>
    The major change is the reduction function: it first destructures
    the parameters, the first into two parts, <em>a</em>
    and <em>finished</em>, the second into <em>b</em>. Then,
    if <em>finished</em> is set, or the length of the current string
    and the next word is over the limit, we return a pair of the first
    string extracted earlier and <em>true</em>, signalling that we're
    finished.
  </p>

  <p>
    If that condition fails, we concatenate our two strings, and slap
    a <em>false</em> after it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm sure it can be done more efficiently, but sadly, my
    Clojure-knowledge is still quite low.
