    Back in May, I was thinking of repurposing this site. However, it
    turned out it's better kept, so that I have a place to post things
    that have no place anywhere else (more on that later - but readers
    will probably notice the new stuff eventually, anyway).

    So instead of repurposing, the site was moved from a Django +
    Zinnia installation to a static site generated by Octopress.
  </p>

  <p>
    This has a few advantages: it came with a reasonably nice theme,
    and I didn't have to write my own, and the generated content is
    all static, and neither the source, nor serving it requires a
    database. I don't like storing my posts and other writings in a
    database... that makes version control quite hard. Now, I can just
    throw it all in git, and be happy.
