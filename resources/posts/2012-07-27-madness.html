  <p>
    This site has a long history. It started out as a database-driven,
    dynamic thing, based on Django + Zinnia, then
    it <a href="/blog/2011/08/20/site-updates/">turned into</a> an
    <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>-powered statically
    generated site.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, I switch again. Today, I praise the power
    of <a href="https://github.com/cgrand/enlive/">Enlive</a>,
    <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>,
    and <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, for they made it
    possible for me to move on.

    There always were annoying little things that bothered me about
    Octopress: from the language, through the complex and fragile
    update mechanism, to the silly source layout. Whenever I tried to
    update, or pull a plugin or extension in, I had to fight with the
    system. I don't like fighting the system.
  </p>

  <p>
    I like simple things. Simple things, that
    allow <strong>me</strong> to control them as I see fit, and don't
    try to shoehorn me into doing things their way.
  </p>

  <h2>Why would I have to copy the theme?</h2>

  <p>
    One part I did not understand about Octopress, is why the complex
    theme & style update mechanism? It's in version control already!
    How about I create a branch, change the theme as I see fit, and
    then merge if I want to update? Would that be so hard?
    No. Granted, that only supports a single theme within a branch,
    but I can live with that.
  </p>

  <h2>Why do I have to learn a new templating language?</h2>

  <p>
    There's a very wide-spread markup language out there, it is
    called <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. When I
    want a new theme, I want to write HTML. I do not want any fancy
    extra moustaches there, nor any other non-sense. I want to be able
    to preview the theme just by loading a single file into my browser
    (of course, with the CSS and everything too).
  </p>

  <h2>What did I do about it?</h2>

  <p>
    I ended up ditching Octopress (yay, no more Ruby on my systems!),
    and wrote my own static site generator. I looked around at first,
    to see if I can find one that matches my needs:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Written in a sane language (Perl, Python, Clojure) </li>
    <li> Simple: the theme is simple HTML/CSS (Less & SASS are ok),
    and nothing else </li>
    <li> It supports usable archives and feeds: whole site and per-tag
    alike </li>
    <li> Simple configuration: whatever can be in the template, should
    be in the template. I like my configs minimal. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Not many requirements, right? But none of the static site
    generators I looked at were able to fulfill all these needs. So, I
    went ahead and wrote my own, that does all of the above.
  </p>

  <p>
    While doing so, I learned to
    love <a href="https://github.com/cgrand/enlive">Enlive</a>,
    because it's insanely powerful. This whole site here is made up of
    two template files: one for the HTML, another for the Atom
    feeds. And that's it. With Enlive, I pull in snippets from the
    template, fill in placeholders, clone & repeat parts of it, and
    transform it into this site. It is actually quite simple, the
    whole code is about 600 lines of code, but once I'm happy with the
    feature set, I will do a refactor round and trim it down a little,
    most probably.
  </p>

  <p>
    I learned to
    love <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>,
    because it made it so much easier to design the look, and have a
    flexible, responsive layout, that - as far as I could test - works
    much better on smartphones than my old site did!
  </p>

  <p>
    I already loved <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, but now
    I love it even more. It was a very interesting, and challenging
    experiment to build a static site generator in a functional
    language. But in the end, composing parts turned out to be a great
    tool.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once cleaned up a little, the code of Madness and this theme will
    all be available at a neighborhood git repository. For now, it's a
    bit of a mess, because I was still learning my way around. You do
    not want to see the code in its current form. Though, those
    interested, will be able to, as it's part of the git history.
  </p>

  <p>
    Soon! Madness will consume you. <em>*cackles madly*</em>
