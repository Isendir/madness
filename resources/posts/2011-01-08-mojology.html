    During the past couple of nights, I was busy coming up with
    something that would showcase the power
    of <a href="http://www.balabit.com/network-security/syslog-ng/opensource-logging-system">syslog-ng</a>
    combined with the <a href="/projects/syslog-ng/mongodb/">mongodb
    destination</a>, and that is
    how <a href="http://mojology.madhouse-project.org/">mojology</a>
    was born.
  </p>

<section>

  <p>
    To sum it up: it's a web based log browser, a reasonably simple
    one: one can't search, or do advanced filtering (yet!), only a few
    basic stuff.
  </p>

  <p>
    The interesting part comes from the fact that the logs it displays
    are stored in <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">mongodb</a>, a
    document store, and as such, the structure of them is very, very
    flexible. Although, the application does make a few assumptions
    (see
    the <a href="http://mojology.madhouse-project.org/about">about
    page</a> or
    the <a href="https://github.com/algernon/mojology/blob/master/README.rst">readme</a>
    in
    the <a href="https://github.com/algernon/mojology">sources</a>),
    it still retains a lot of flexibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without going into the gory details (that's what the source is for
    ;), let me show you a few interesting pages!
  </p>

  <h2>Examples<hr></h2>

  <h3><a href="http://mojology.madhouse-project.org/log/4d28cd01f310ef4f00000024">Hacking
  the database</a></h3>

  <p>This one was originally made with the following command:</p>

  <pre>logger -i -t hi 'Hello World! This concludes our demo session.'</pre>

  <p>
    Then I went into the MongoDB shell and added a few other keys
    below the <strong>dyn</strong> sub-document, alongside the default
    <strong>classifier</strong> (courtesy of patterndb).
  </p>

  <p>
    As you can see, no matter how deep one nests, it still displays
    properly. It's also easy to query, even at such depths.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="http://mojology.madhouse-project.org/log/4d28cba4f310ef4f0000001e">Logging
  in via SSH</a></h3>

  <p>
    Logging in from one computer to my desktop, using password
    authentication. This entry was made fully automatically.
  </p>

  <h2>Other notes</h2>

  <p>
    The database behind the demo application is fairly small, only 39
    messages stored, but hey, it's a demo!
  </p>

  <p>
    The program itself is a little over a hundred lines of python +
    templates; built upon <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>
    & <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver/">PyMongo</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the best experience, a recent browser is strongly advised:
    Chromium 6+, Firefox 4+ for best results; Firefox 3 works very
    well too, but some of the tiny cosmetic features do not; the site
    displays in IE7+ too, and can be used, but the experience is
    rather disappointing.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope this little weekend hack helps demonstrate how flexible
    <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">mongodb</a> can be for logging,
    and how
    well <a href="http://www.balabit.com/network-security/syslog-ng/opensource-logging-system">syslog-ng</a>
    can make use of that flexibility.
  </p>
