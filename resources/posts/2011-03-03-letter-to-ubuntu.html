    Dear Ubuntu / Canonical!
  </p>

  <p>
    I have been slowly but steadily getting disappointed with your
    distribution. It started with using a color scheme that was just
    plain ugly, then it evolved to something even more gross. But I
    could live with that, because I could change it with a few
    clicks.

  <p>
    Then it went through moving the window controls to the other side,
    which was fine, as I wasn't using the default window borders
    anyway (I prefer my windows lean and clean, I don't need no
    minimize button, nor a close, I do want a sticky button, however).
  </p>

  <p>
    Then you started to use and promote upstart, which I understand is
    godly and all, but it broke my <em>update-rc.d</em>: to disable a
    service, I couldn't do <code>update-rc.d <strong>service</strong>
    disable</code> anymore, I had to figure out how to disable
    services painlessly. I still prefer the old way, which worked for
    years.
  </p>


  <p>
    But that's fine too, I could adapt, I could work it around.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then you decided to design a unique font. I understand you want to
    go and promote your branding and all, but honestly, I can't see a
    difference between the new font, and whatever I was using
    before. But that's ok, it's your money, I just don't see the
    point, and changing the default font is a matter of a few clicks
    anyway. So I didn't mind this much, either, as I had a choice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then you recently decided to
    use <a href="http://banshee.fm/">Banshee</a> as the default
    music player, which I applauded, as I'm a Banshee user myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    But then you decided to castrate it, and make the useless Ubuntu
    Store (or whatever it is called) the default. Which I wouldn't
    mind, since I could easily switch back to something useful, which
    also happens to generate some money for the GNOME foundation. But
    then you made it so that the upstream default Amazon MP3 Store
    would make referral fees go to Canonical (at least most of it).
  </p>

  <p>
    And this is where I gave up. Up until now, if I wanted to use the
    system as I please, I could, I had a choice. With this change, you
    took my choice away: if I want to use Banshee and it's Amazon MP3
    Store plugin the way its developers intended, and give 100% of the
    referral fees to the <a href="http://foundation.gnome.org/">GNOME
    Foundation</a>, I will have to compile Banshee myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Granted, I can do that. But then I can use another distribution too.
  </p>

  <p>
    Up until now, I have recommended Ubuntu to friends and family, but
    due to these issues and others, I will no longer do so, because
    even <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> is more friendly
    towards its users, even though it is perceived as mostly a geek
    distribution.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will not thank you for all the years I've been using your
    distribution, because frankly, I didn't enjoy it all that much. My
    trusty old Debian gave me far fewer headaches, and didn't try to
    dictate what I want to do, it let me go and explore whatever and
    whenever I wanted to.
  </p>

  <p>
    I still have one Ubuntu system running, due to company policy, but
    it will be migrated
    to <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/squeeze/">Squeeze</a>
    at the first opportunity (if so need be, I'll hook up an Ubuntu
    system in a virtual machine).
  </p>

  <p>
    Yours truly, A <a href="http://banshee.fm/">Banshee</a> user
