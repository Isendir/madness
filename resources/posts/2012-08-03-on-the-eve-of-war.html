    On the eve of the first battle of what later became known as
    the <em>Dream Wars</em>, people were scared, frightened: facing
    against uneven odds, and He has not been seen or heard of for
    days. Panic started to spread.

    Seeing the enemy fires, their hearts became filled with a sense of
    imminent destruction. Their own demise. But there was no turning
    back now. That night, from within the shadows of the campfires He
    came - as always, unnoticed. He came as the dark between the
    flames, something that's always there, yet never is.

  <p>
    But when He spoke, they listened.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>"I know you. I know you all too well: the fear in your
    hearts, the love you bear for one another, the courage you have,
    coming here against all odds. I heard you, and I came, but not to
    lead you into battle - you do not need me to lead. I came not to
    drive fear out of your hearts, for I cannot do that. I came to
    tell you what you've all seem forgotten, I came to scold you for
    the foolish ideas you got in your heads."</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>"I witnessed prayers, I heard people calling my name - as
    if I were a God! Let me assure you, I am not. You all are, and I
    am the tiny speck of dust in the great play. You make the world
    turn, You make my prayers come true! Who, if not the gods are the
    ones answering a man's prayer? You, my friends, are the Gods, not
    me. I am only a powerless man, with a wish. A wish, you are about
    to make come true. At Dawn, we will face the enemy that
    wants <strong>our</strong> dreams! Do Gods let their dreams fall
    apart? They do not!"</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>"Many will perish, but no matter how many of us they
    slaughter, our dreams never die. We will rise up, - from the
    grave, if we have to, - and fight, for neither dreams, nor Gods
    ever die!"</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    As the Legend says, this was the first time He dropped his hood,
    and people saw him as He truly was: a broken old man, grey hair,
    grey eyes, no more, no less.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>"You came all the way, ready to go up against an enemy none
    could stand up against yet. You came, becuase you heard my prayer,
    and as great Gods as you are, you saw my dream, and saw that it
    was Your dream too. As long as the dream lives, there always will
    be a Dreamer."</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    People dreamt that night, and the battle was all but won.
