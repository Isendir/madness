    I'm a lazy person. When I'm at the computer, tinkering with
    something, I want to get done fast, I do not want to fight with the
    system, I just want to install whatever tools I need, and start
    hacking away.

    For this reason, I strongly prefer installing packages from my
    distribution, globally, so that they are available to all of my
    projects. This is a fast and reliable way to get started, since my
    distribution of choice has fairly high quality packages. I trust
    the maintainers that they make sure that upgrades won't break
    existing software, and if a new upstream version comes out, which
    is not backwards compatible, they'll handle it in a sane way:
    create a new binary package. Security fixes can then be backported
    to the old version still in the distribution, and one is not
    forced to upgrade every component that uses a particular module,
    just because a security fix came out, and one had to upgrade to a
    completely new version.

  <p>
    Part of the reason I absolutely <strong>hate</strong> ruby
    nowadays is due to their stance of <quote>"We're a fast moving
    community. Keep up, or get out"</quote>. It has often been my
    experience that many gems broke backwards compatibility without a
    warning, within a minor revision. I don't like that. I hate
    that. That forces me to update everything I wrote that uses said
    gem, because I'm sure as hell not going to keep a million
    different versions lying around on my system.

  <p>
    When I read stories such
    as <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you/">this</a>,
    which, I quote:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Under no circumstance should you install Ruby, Rubygems or any
    Ruby-related packages from apt-get.  This system is out-dated and
    leads to major headaches. Avoid it for Ruby-related packages. We
    do Ruby, we know what's best. Trust us.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I get angry. They might do Ruby, but they're not distribution
    maintainers. It's not their area of expertise, and to be frank,
    they're doing a very poor job at that. I trust the Debian
    maintainers, because I know them, I have been one myself, and they
    made an amazing distribution, which haven't failed me since I
    first installed it in 1999. Ruby, and ruby gems failed me within
    an hour, and I should trust <strong>them</strong>? Bloody hell,
    <strong>NO</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If I wanted to compile everything myself, I would use a source
    based distribution. But I don't have time for that: I want my
    stuff to work, out of the box. That's why I use a
    distribution. And frankly, the Debian Ruby maintainers do hell of
    a good job! Working within such a hostile environment must be
    frustrating, yet, the quality of most ruby packages in Debian is
    fairly good.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am using redmine (installed via apt-get), works fine, as long as
    I don't need the newer features. I tried to install a new version
    once, and after two hours of immense pain, I gave up. At that
    point, I made a vow: if I ever have to use anything ruby, it will
    be from the Debian repository. I'm never ever going to use RVM or
    gems or any of the other nonsense they came up with.
  </p>

  <p>
    But better yet, I will try my best to steer clear of Ruby: however
    a good language it might be (though, I fail to see it's
    greatness), the community hates me, even though they don't know
    me. So, no thanks, no Ruby for me.
