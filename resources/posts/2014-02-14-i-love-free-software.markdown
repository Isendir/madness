I love Free Software, and the people behind it. Even though I have
been a free software user and developer for more than a decade now,
there's still more to be amazed at, still more to contribute, and
still more to learn. I love the Free Software community, because it
never ceases to amaze me. It's not just about the technical side, but
the social, human side of it, too!

During the past year, I came to another milestone in my career: as of
july first, [I am a Free Software developer][sng:ose], and enjoying
every moment of it. This is a feat that could not have been done
without there being demand for what I do, without the free software
community as a whole. For that, I owe you all a big **thank you**, you
make it possible for me to make my dream come true. I can only hope
that through my work, and through my example, I can contribute back
enough.

To this day, I take delight in contributing to free software, be it a
[Lisp on Python][hy] (or projects [built in it][adderall]), any of my
own projects, [syslog-ng][syslog-ng], Google Summer of Code mentoring,
Debian work - any and all of that are great fun. Even processing NEW
is (I really should do that more often)! It's an endless source of not
only entertainment and knowledge, but inspiration too.

Whenever I read something as amazing as Russ Allbery's mail on the
Debian [technical committee impasse][rra-ctte], I realize just how
amazing people we have in our community, and how much we all can learn
from them, and how much we owe them. This is yet another reason why I
feel that contributing to Free Software is a passion many can share,
because it teaches us good values too, atop of being technically
excellent.

I love Free Software, because without it, I would be lost. Thank you.
