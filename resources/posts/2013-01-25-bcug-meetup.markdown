We here at [BalaBit][balabit] - being an innovative tech company - are
always on the lookout for emerging technologies, and we believe that
when an opportunity presents itself to help one of these gain foothold
in our very own country, we do our best to support that. For these
reasons, and more, we're glad to host the first
[Budapest Clojure User Group Meetup][bcug] in our office, on the 29th
of January!

**But what is [Clojure][clj]?** It is a modern dialect of the
[LISP][lisp] family of programming languages, originally built on top
of the [Java Virtual Machine][jvm], a functional language, with strong
focus on concurrencty, and being practical.

Due to these properties and more - including but not limited to being
ported to other platforms, such as JavaScript
([ClojureScript][cljs])-, the language is being adopted quickly by
many organisations around the world.

## Who's using Clojure in production?

It's used at [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) (see
[Storm](http://storm-project.net/), a distributed and fault tolerant
realtime computation system, for example); and
[Prismatic](http://getprismatic.com/), who built their whole stack,
backend and fronted alike on [Clojure][clj] and [ClojureScript][cljs];
and a
[whole lot of others](http://dev.clojure.org/display/community/Clojure+Success+Stories).

It made it to the ["Adopt" section][tradar-pic] of the
[ThoughtWorks Tech Radar][radar] in October 2012; and
[Robert C. Martin][unclebob] of [Clean Coder][cleancoder] fame also
wrote a [series][fp1] [of][fp2] [posts][fp3] about functional
programming and Clojure in particular.

## Why we started using Clojure?

At [BalaBit][balabit], we have a [project][bb.lgs] or [two][bb.b]
written in Clojure as well, with more to come for sure. I, for one, am
writing pretty much every new software of my own design in this
language. The wide range of Java libraries is astounding, and thanks
to Clojure's interoperability with the host platform, I can use all of
them, without having to write a single line of Java code. I can hide
the uglyness behind thin macros or libraries, I can make my code look
not only readable, but easily understandable!

Functional programming opened up a whole new world for me, made me
realize that **data** is one of the most important part of my
program. That code just happens to be smarter data, is a huge boon
too. With immutability, I can feel safe when writing highly concurrent
programs, but being a practical language as Clojure is, I still have
access to mutability, if the task at hand demands that.

The ideas I learned while watching talks about Clojure and related
fields, while I wrote code in the language also made me able to write
much better code in other languages aswell. No wonder I jumped onto
the [user group ship][bcug] as soon as it came up.

## The Meetup

There are already a number of [existing user groups][cugs] worldwide
too, so when [Balint Erdi][baaz] started one in Budapest, we found the
idea great, and thus, will host the [first meetup][meetup1] in our
office. Anyone interested in the language is welcome, the more the
merrier! Feel free to sign up either at [meetup.com][meetup1], or
contact [Balint][baaz] or [myself](mailto:algernon@balabit.hu)
directly.

On this first meetup, the plan is to figure out how future meetups
will be organised - how often, where, what topics to include, and so
on and so forth. Needless to say, we all want this to be a periodic,
and interesting event for a wide range of people, whether they're
interested in Clojure itself, or just about emerging technologies.

A rough plan of the meetup is as follows, all times being rough
estimates only:

* **19:00 - 19:10**: Everyone arrives, and sits down comfortably.
* **19:10 - 19:20**: Short introductions.
* **19:20 - 20:00**: Intro to Clojure (slides & presentation in
    English).
* **20:00 - **: Discussing future plans, and the next meetup.    

While we won't have live coverage (except for tweets, perhaps), I'll
definitely post my summary after the event on this blog.
