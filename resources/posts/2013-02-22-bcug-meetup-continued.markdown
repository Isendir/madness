We had our [first][first-bcug] and [second][second-bcug] meetup of the
[Budapest Clojure User Group][bcug], and I enjoyed them both, even
though I spent an awful lot of time preparing for [my talk][tod] for
the second meetup. Quite a lot of people showed up, more than on the
first, and that's a good sign! The feedback was better than I
anticipated too, so the journey [will continue][third-bcug]!

I don't usually get much feedback after a talk, but after the last
[meetup][second-bcug], there was a common theme in what I heard back:
**interactivity is good**! That's the theme I'll be trying to take
further on our [next event][third-bcug], held at the
[same place][balabit-location], on March 19 at 19:00. The topic will
be [Conway's Game of Life][gol-wikipedia], and I plan to have a fairly
interactive session, where we first implement the game in an
imperative language (python), then translate it to Clojure, along with
tests, and then step by step, slowly refactor it into something that
looks, feels and behaves functionally. The goal is to involve the
participants, to make them think in Clojure, and see the beauty of the
language.

I plan to use some interesting libraries to spark further interest, in
the shape of [Quil][quil], for example. If time allows - and if I
manage to prepare in time -, I will also translate the result to
ClojureScript, and use something like [midi.js][midi-js] to make not
only a visible representation of the game, but an audible one too.

I'm not sure how that will work out, but at least the plan sounds
interesting! And even if I don't manage to get the audio part done, at
least there will be an idea for the fourth meetup!

As always, I will try to engineer the talk in a way that those who
never saw the language before will still get something out of it. So
even if you've never heard of Clojure before, or never programmed in a
functional language, come, and join us on the 19th of March!
