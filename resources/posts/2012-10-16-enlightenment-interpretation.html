    Dark thoughts about Master wall, the Disciple and tea - not

  <p>
    Enlightenment has many levels, and so
    has <a href="/blog/2012/09/13/enlightenment/">our story</a>: on
    one hand, it is a spectacular example of a particular way of
    teaching, one where the disciple can observe, but he's constantly
    forced to make discoveries on his own. Why that matters? It does,
    because it emphasizes thinking and self-improvement, things a
    young mind desperately needs. We oft forget this, and fill
    brilliant, free minds with needless rigor; we lock them up in the
    cage of <em>Well Known</em>, and they suffocate. Instead, Master
    wall leads by example, but at the same time, he lets himself be
    led, or even more: demands a helping hand to guide his fragile
    steps.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, there is another level to it: the master on his own has
    limits, and by mere copying, the student would have them too. But
    working together, those limits all but disappear.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally on the level of the - the product -, copying does not
    matter. But observing its history - and the way it is made - will
    allow us to do better, to improve upon the original design!
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course all of these can be applied to our field: software
    development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thousands - if not millions - of young minds are enslaved yearly
    by methods, patterns and broken old principles. By the time
    universities are done with them, only a few remain that escaped
    the curse of tunnel vision, but even their imagination began to
    wane.
  </p>

  <p>
    And once they join the rat race, they're either on their own to
    drown in a task or solve it in one single way they were taught. Or
    they get assigned to a team, and like trained monkeys, do as they
    are told. Shallow, unfulfilling way of life.
  </p>

  <p>
    And the software? Locked in a black, proprietary box, it slowly
    dies, and that is all its legacy: a black void of unknown, waiting
    to be reinvented over and over again.
  </p>

  <p>
    But there is always hope that we will eventually do things right,
    that instead of forcing paradigms down each others throat, we will
    teach and educate. That we'll work with, and not against one
    another. And we'll share our knowledge, the information this
    modern world is built upon. We will write code in our own image:
    free.
