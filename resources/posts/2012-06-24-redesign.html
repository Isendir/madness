    A few days ago, for a plaetora of reasons, I tried to upgrade my
    <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> to a newer
    version. I failed, miserably. It served me well for a year, but
    past and current annoyances triggered a drastical move: away from
    it.

  <p>
    There always were annoying little things that bothered me about
    Octopress: from the language, through the complex and fragile
    update mechanism, to the silly source layout.
  </p>

  <p>
    To this day, I do not understand why it has to be so complex. And
    for that reason, out of frustration, I am now in the middle of
    redesigning and rearchitecting this site from scratch. I'm
    building not only the design, but the static site generator too
    this time.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Why?</em> one might rightfully ask - there are a million
    generators out there! And that is true, but none that I checked
    was easy enough to use, or if it was, it did not provide all the
    features I need. Neither did Octopress, by the way...
  </p>

  <p>
    So, here I am, in the middle of it all, and I already have
    something built
    with <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/cgrand/enlive">enlive</a> and
    <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the new system, I have a modern layout, which I find much
    easier to tweak (it's a single file, afterall), I have proper
    per-tag Atom feeds, gained quite a bit of control on how my site
    is built up, and it also generates noticably faster. Oh, and I do
    not need ruby for anything, anymore!
