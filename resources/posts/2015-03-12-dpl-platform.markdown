## Apology

As a twisted turn of fate, I need to start my platform with an
apology. Last year, I [withdrew][2014:wd] my nomination, because my
life [turned upside down][2014:happy], and the effects of that are
still felt today, and will continue to have a considerable footprint
for the rest of my life. But this is not what I want to apologise for!
I want to apologise because my nomination, my platform, and my plans
are rather uncommon - or so I believe. Unlike past Project Leaders, if
elected, I will not have as much time to travel, as some of them. Nor
will I have the resources to do all the things one may expect from a
Project Leader. But - as you'll read later - I consider this both the
biggest weakness and the greatest strength of my platform.

Furthermore, I will not be available from the second half of the
voting period until after the new Project Leader's term starts: I'll
be getting married, and will enjoy a nice honeymoon, and as such, my
email will remain unread from the 9th of April until we're back on the
21st of April.

## On the mouse behind the keyboard

My name is Gergely Nagy, or *algernon*, for those of you who may know
me by my online presence. I used to be a lot of things: a
[flaming youth][mbk:youth], an [application manager][mbk:am],
[package maintainer][mbk:maint], upstream,
[ftp-assistant][mbk:ftpassist], a student, a [mentor][mbk:gsoc], a
hacker. In the end, however, I am but a simple, albeit
[sometimes crazy][mbk:crazy] person. I imagine, a lot of people
reading this will not know me, and that is actually not only fine, but
in my case, desirable.

## The Role of the Project Leader

The role of the Project Leader, what people perceive about the role,
and what is actually done by one single person changed dramatically
over time. In some ways for the better, some ways for the worse. It
should be sufficiently clear by now that if we combine all the things
past Project Leaders have done, and what people expect the Project
Leader to do, then not even all the time in the world would be enough
to accomplish everything. On the other hand, we should not cut the
responsibilities back to [constitution-granted][constitution:dpl] ones
only.

There has been [some discussion][dpl:thread] about this very topic on
debian-project@, back in February, with excellent observations by both
past Project Leaders and the current one. I encourage my dear readers
to stop reading this platform now, and read at least
[Lucas's mail][dpl:lucas]. I'll be right here when you get back.

Back? Good.

You may notice that unlike in [previous][platform:2012]
[years][platform:2013], I do not have a *Grand Vision*, not in the
same sense at least. No matter what I envision, however noble that
vision may be, it is not the Project Leader's job to save the world,
so to say. While I still believe that we have serious problems with
motivation, inspiration and innovation within the project, the Project
Leader is the wrong person to try and solve these issues with.

Apart from the [constitutionally required][constitution:dpl]
responsibilities, the primary purpose of the Project Leader in my
opinion, is to be an enabler: the Project Leader is not a front runner
to lead the herd to victory, but a gentle shepherd to make them happy.

## Happy

There are many ways to make people happy. One such way is to enable
them to pursue their passion - and not just enable them, but encourage
and fuel that passion, too! -, to remove barriers, to empower them, or
in a lot of cases, to include them in the first place. My vision is a
project that is greater than *just* an amazing distribution. More than
a role model for technical excellence. I want to do away with
[territorial pissings][yt:tp] (with which I don't mean to imply that
this would be the general atmosphere within the project - far from
it!), and would rather see a warm, welcoming culture within the
project - the kind of "*I'm home!*" feeling I had at the DebConfs I
had the privilege to attend -, on public and private media alike.

That is the vision I have, but I can't do it. At best, I can hope to
enable people much better at the these things to do what needs to be
done. I wish to take the burden of administration, bureaucracy off
their shoulders, so they can focus on what they do best. I feel that
this is the most important part of being a Project Leader: to enable
the project to grow. And this is why I feel that most of you not
knowing my name is an advantage here: When you look at a beautiful
flower, you admire the flower itself, rarely the gardener.

## In the end

I wish to be the Project Leader no one remembers. I'd rather see
people remember all the great things the Project - as a whole -
accomplished, for there are many. My purpose is to let You pursue your
passion, which in turn enables even more people to pursue their
happiness, and allows the greater Free Software community to bask in
the warm glow of accomplished dreams.
