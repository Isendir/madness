    While available for a week or two already, it took me a while to
    update my <a href="/projects/debian/">debian project page</a> to
    include it, but nevertheless, it is done: I am now
    providing <a href="http://www.balabit.com/network-security/zorp-gpl/overview">Zorp
    GPL</a> APT repositories!
  </p>
</summary>

<section>
  <p>
    For the repository URLs, please see
    the <a href="/projects/debian/">project page</a>, as that will
    always be kept up to date.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike the syslog-ng packages, the ones in the Zorp GPL repository
    were not repackaged from scratch, and only the minimum was done to
    them, only enough to make it possible to build and support them
    for all platforms I host packages for. This is the reason why
    there is no git repository for them, at least, not yet: there are
    plans to get things right, and maintain a git repository aswell,
    but that will need to wait a while, as that's more effort than
    what I can spare right now.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now go out and play! The repository contains fully functional
    packages for modern (and not so modern) distributions, with
    KZorp-enabled kernels and tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    A simple <code>apt-get install zorp iptables</code> should install
    everything you need, but a kernel. The kernel can be installed -
    as of this writing - with a command like <code>apt-get install
    linux-image-2.6.32-5+kzorp-amd64</code> (or <code>-486</code>, if
    you're on a 32-bit system, and don't want a 64bit kernel).
