    I have played
    with <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/solaris/solaris11/overview/index.html">Solaris</a>
    a few times in the past, but it always ended up in disappointment,
    after long and cruel battles with trying to get things into
    shape. Compiling and
    running <a href="http://www.balabit.com/network-security/syslog-ng/opensource-logging-system/overview">syslog-ng</a>
    on this platform proved to be quite a challenge.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today I gave it another try, and found
    the <a href="http://www.opencsw.org/">OpenCSW</a> project, and
    figured I'll try getting things up and running with the help of
    these packages.

  <h2>Setting up the environment</h2>

  <p>
    First, I had to install an environment I'm comfortable with, all
    the packages syslog-ng needs to build and run, and all the tools I
    need to debug it.
  </p>

  <p>
    We'll need a compiler, header files, git, and a whole lot of other
    stuff syslog-ng depends on. With much further ado:
  </p>

  <pre># pkgadd -d http://get.opencsw.org/now
# export PATH=/opt/csw/bin:$PATH
# pkg install system/header
# pkgutil -y -i vim git autoconf automake libtool gmake libglib2_dev \
                eventlog_dev docbook libxslt docbookxsl libwrap_dev \
                bison flex_new gcc4core pkgconfig libnet_dev gdb</pre>

  <p>
    This will install a reasonably modern environment, with most
    everything I needed for the time being.
  </p>

  <h2>Getting & compiling syslog-ng</h2>

  <p>
    Armed with modern tools, it turns out, that compiling syslog-ng is
    not such a big deal afterall!
  </p>

  <pre>$ git clone git://github.com/balabit/syslog-ng-3.3.git
$ cd syslog-ng-3.3
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/syslog-ng \
              LEX=/opt/csw/bin/flex-2.5.35
$ gmake XSL_STYLESHEET=/opt/csw/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets/manpages/docbook.xsl
$ sudo gmake install</pre>

  <p>
    Ta-da! Up and running in no time whatsoever, not any more painful
    than on any contemporary GNU/Linux distribution. No more hunting
    dependencies and old packages on sunfreeware, no more compiling
    lots of stuff by hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was very pleasantly suprised that once adding
    the <a href="http://www.opencsw.org/">OpenCSW</a> repository,
    everything went smoothly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course, there is still work to do, to make syslog-ng act as the
    syslogd on Solaris, but thatâ€™s for another day.
