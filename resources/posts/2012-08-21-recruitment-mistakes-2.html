    After the <a href="/blog/2011/12/13/google-fail/">previous
    incident</a> all seemed well. I did not get contacted again, so
    the plan worked. Sadly, I have to add a few items to the list
    posted earlier, as it seems the recruiting business is in
    desperate need of my sarcastic powers.

  <p>
    As a first rule of thumb, when you - the recruiter - mail a
    prospect, be sure to mention you found him through
    his <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1225446/algernon">stackoverflow
    profile</a>, with about two questions answered, that have nearly
    no connection to the opportunities you will later mention.  By no
    means mention
    the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=algernon%20%22Gergely%20Nagy%22">vast
    amount</a> of other, relevant references available! The prospect
    may end up feeling good, and that leads to self-valuation, which
    means he'll ask for a higher salary. That would be bad, so don't
    do it!
  </p>

  <p>
    Don't worry about the prospect
    having <a href="http://www.debian.org/vote/2012/platforms/algernon">plans</a>
    that would obviously conflict with working at your company. Money
    can buy anything, right?
  </p>

  <p>
    And last, but not least, when the prospect replies to your mail
    within 24 hours, and is expecting a response, leave him hanging
    for at least a week. You're part of an enterprise business, things
    take time. He should be patient, and feel grateful even for having
    received your initial mail!
  </p>

  <p>
    In case these guidelines do not have the desired effect, please
    consult the great guys over
    at <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">RedHat</a>, because they have
    first-hand experience in abiding these.
