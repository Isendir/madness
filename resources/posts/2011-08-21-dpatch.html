    As of a couple of hours
    ago, <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/dpatch">dpatch</a>
    2.0.32
    has <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/d/dpatch/news/20110821T173217Z.html">arrived</a>
    to Debian unstable. This marks my return as maintainer, after six
    years of absence. To celebrate, the upload closes an impressive
    number of bugs: <strong>20</strong>.

    However, sad as it may be, I still stick to my opinion about
    dpatch, which I expressed on a short talk I gave at the last
    LinuxTag I attended some years ago: it's a temporary solution to a
    problem that is better solved elsewhere.
  </p>

  <p>
    That problem has been solved, in multiple ways to boot, so it is
    time for dpatch to step down and slowly back out of Debian. As I
    wrote in
    my <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.debian.devel.general/164595">mail
    to debian-devel@</a>, I plan to migrate it out of Debian by 2017.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're reading this, and you maintain a package that uses
    dpatch, look forward to a patch from me, sometime in the next six
    years!
