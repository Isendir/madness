    As <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.syslog-ng/13639">announced
    earlier</a>, <a href="http://www.balabit.com/network-security/syslog-ng/opensource-logging-system/overview">syslog-ng
    OSE 3.3</a> has a new maintainer, yours truly. With this new hat on,
    I <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.syslog-ng/13647">posted
    a roadmap</a> to the mailing list, which I will not repeat here,
    not in detail anyway.
  </p>

  <p>
    Being a stable series, there aren't many things I'll change, the
    major thing is that I will provide a separate patch along the
    source tarball that makes it possible to use upstream ivykis with
    syslog-ng, instead of the patched work it currently includes. This
    should make it easier for distributions that dislike (or even
    forbid) embedded copies, while still maintaining the current
    patched version as a default for everyone else. Eventually, the
    remaining patches will be sent upstream too, but that's out of the
    scope of the 3.3 series.
  </p>

  <p>
    Apart from that, the rest of the roadmap items are various fixes
    that turned up after the last 3.3.5 release. If all goes well,
    we'll have a 3.3.6 release in a couple of weeks, targeting
    mid-June. At that point, it would even be possible to get a
    syslog-ng into Debian which uses the upstream ivykis library, and
    that would make me
    <strong>very</strong> happy.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'd like to grab this opportunity to ask interested parties to
    test syslog-ng 3.3, and report any issues either to the mailing
    list, or to
    our <a href="http://bugzilla.balabit.com/">BugZilla</a>, so that
    3.3.6 becomes a rock solid release, and so that I won't have to do
    a 3.3.7. While I'm flattered by Bazsi's trust in me, and I enjoy
    working on syslog-ng, my goal in this case is to have a single
    rock solid release, as that benefits everyone best. I hope I will
    be able to achieve that goal.
