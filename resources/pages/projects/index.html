  <p>
    I have a couple of interesting projects going, most of them are
    available at <a href="https://github.com/algernon/">github</a>,
    but there's a few that are worth a special mention.
  </p>

  <h2>
    <a href="http://www.bajcsinagy.com/">Bajcsi-Nagy Bal√°zs's
      portfolio</a>
  </h2>

  <p>
    My brother's portfolio site, only available in
    hungarian. Statically generated with Clojure, uses jQuery and
    Bootstrap and a couple of other things.
  </p>

  <h2><a href="/projects/debian/">Debian</a></h2>

  <p>
    I also contribute to
    the <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> distribution in various ways.
