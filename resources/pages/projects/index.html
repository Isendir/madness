  <p>
    I have a couple of interesting projects going, most of them are
    available at <a href="https://github.com/algernon/">github</a>,
    but there's a few that are worth a special mention.
  </p>

  <h2>
    <a href="http://www.bajcsinagy.com/">Bajcsi-Nagy Bal√°zs's
      portfolio</a><hr>
  </h2>

  <p>
    My brother's portfolio site, only available in hungarian. It is
    built with Django, and a bit of JQuery here and there.
  </p>

  <h2><a href="/projects/syslog-ng/">syslog-ng</a><hr></h2>

  <p>
    I spend most of my free time hacking
    on <a href="http://www.balabit.com/network-security/syslog-ng/opensource-logging-system">syslog-ng</a>,
    and as such, I have a couple of projects that relate to it, namely
    the <a href="/projects/syslog-ng/mongodb/">syslog-ng mongodb
    driver</a> and a simple web-based log browser, called
    <a href="https://github.com/algernon/mojology">mojology</a>.
  </p>

  <h2><a href="/projects/debian/">Debian</a><hr></h2>

  <p>
    I also contribute to
    the <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> distribution, not
    only as
    a <a href="http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=algernon%40madhouse-project.org">package
    maintainer</a>, but - among other things - I keep an eye on
    misfiled bugs, and reassign them.
  </p>

  <p>
    For my own needs, I made updated packages of some selected
    software (syslog-ng 3.3 for example), see
    my <a href="/projects/debian/">repository page</a> for more
    information about these.
