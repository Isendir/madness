title: Debian repository

I used to host selected packages (of [syslog-ng][sng] and
[syslog-ng-incubator][sng-incubator]) compiled for a number of
[Debian][debian] and [Ubuntu][ubuntu] releases. Unfortunately, due to
a number of reasons, I no longer update these.

The latest state of the packaging - along with ample documentation -
is available on [GitHub][sng-debian].
