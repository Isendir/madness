title: Debian repository
---

I used to host selected packages (of [syslog-ng][sng] and
[syslog-ng-incubator][sng-incubator]) compiled for a number of
[Debian][debian] and [Ubuntu][ubuntu] releases. Unfortunately, due to
a number of reasons, I no longer update these. The repository will
remain available for a good while, but there are no plans to update
the contents.

If anyone is interested in taking the task over, let me know: I am
more than happy to share the scripts I used, and explain how the
packages and the repositories were built. I am also happy to refer
visitors to any new repository that turns up, and is of sufficient
quality.
