  <title>MongoDB destination for syslog-ng</title>
</article>

<section>
  <p>
    For reasons
    explained <a href="/blog/2010/12/30/logging-mongodb-syslog-ng/">elsewhere</a>,
    I wrote a <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>
    destination driver
    for <a href="https://www.balabit.com/network-security/syslog-ng/opensource-logging-system">syslog-ng</a>. Since
    it changed since I posted
    that <a href="/blog/2010/12/30/logging-mongodb-syslog-ng/">article</a>,
    and updating that constantly, or posting new entries would be
    counter intuitive, I decided to make a project page for it
    instead.
  </p>

  <h2>Obtaining<hr></h2>

  <p>
    The afmongodb driver has been merged into the
    official <a href="https://github.com/balabit/syslog-ng-3.3">syslog-ng
    3.3</a> tree.
  </p>

  <h2>Features<hr></h2>

  <p>
    Apart from being able to connect to MongoDB and do what is
    expected: send messages, the driver has the following features:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Does not log empty keys </li>
    <li> The key-value pairs to log are fully configurable </li>
    <li> Supports logging all dynamic variables, without the need to
      list them all </li>
    <li> Sane defaults, working right out of the box! </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Configuration<hr></h2>

  <p>
    For the most simple case, when running a local mongodb server, one
    only has to enable the driver:
  </p>

  <pre>destination d_mongodb {
  mongodb();
};</pre>

  <p>
    The configuration is reasonably well documented in the syslog-ng
    <a href="https://www.balabit.com/sites/default/files/documents/syslog-ng-ose-3.3-guides/syslog-ng-ose-v3.3-guide-admin-en.html/bk01-toc.html">admin
    guide</a>: the mongodb driver specifics
    in <a href="https://www.balabit.com/sites/default/files/documents/syslog-ng-ose-3.3-guides/syslog-ng-ose-v3.3-guide-admin-en.html/reference_destination_mongodb.html">one
    section</a>, the value-pairs syntax
    in <a href="https://www.balabit.com/sites/default/files/documents/syslog-ng-ose-3.3-guides/syslog-ng-ose-v3.3-guide-admin-en.html/concepts-value-pairs.html">another</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have also written
    a <a href="/blog/2012/04/26/mongodb-howto/">HOWTO</a> that
    explores the possibilities of <code>value-pairs()</code>, with tips,
    tricks and examples.
  </p>

  <h2>Structuring<hr></h2>

  <p>
    Since I started talking about structuring messages, lets explore
    that a little bit more! With MongoDB being schema-free, we can
    structure our documents, the log messages in a much more elegant
    and straightforward way than with any other destination driver to
    this date. What do I mean by that? We can put information that
    belongs together, together. Let me illustrate this with an
    example:
  </p>

  <div class="pygmentize" data-language="javascript">{ "_id" : ObjectId("4d236e339d864e5600000002"),
  "DATE" : "Jan  4 20:00:03",
  "classifier" : {
    "class" : "system",
    "rule_id" : "4dd5a329-da83-4876-a431-ddcb59c2858c"
  },
  "secevt" : { "verdict" : "ACCEPT" },
  "usracct" : {
    "application" : "sshd",
    "authmethod" : "publickey",
    "device" : "::1",
    "service" : "ssh2",
    "sessionid" : "10070",
    "type" : "login",
    "username" : "algernon"
  }
  "HOST" : "localhost",
  "FACILITY" : "auth", "PRIORITY" : "info",
  "MESSAGE" : "Accepted publickey for algernon from ::1 port 33495 ssh2",
  "PROGRAM" : "sshd", "PID" : "10070"
}</div>

  <p>
    Well structured, yet, still easily queryable.
  </p>

  <p>
    The above can be achieved with the default settings, and the
    structure is fully customisable with the use
    of <code>value-pairs()</code>!
  </p>

  <h2>Notes<hr></h2>

  <p>
    The driver does not - and will not - support creating indexes, as
    that can be a very complex operation in MongoDB (think compound
    indexes), so it is left up to the administrator to make sure
    indexes exist on all their collections.
  </p>

  <h2>Demo</h2>

  <p>
    A simple demonstration that showcases the power of the driver can
    be viewed on
    the <a href="http://mojology.madhouse-project.org/">mojology</a>
    demo site.
