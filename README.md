Madness
=======

`madness` is a static-site generation tool that I use to to build my
own [website][1]. As of now, there is little to no documentation, but
checking out the `asylum` branch, one will be able to peek at how
templates, posts and pages look.

At some point, as time allows, more documentation will be written. For
now, use the source!
